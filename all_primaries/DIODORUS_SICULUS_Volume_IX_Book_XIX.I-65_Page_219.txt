Diodorus of Sicily


Τάδε ἔνεστιν ἐν τῇ ἐννεακαιδεκάτῃ τῶν Διοδώρου βύβλων
Περὶ τῶν ἀφορμῶν αἷς χρησάμενος Ἀγαθοκλῆς τύραννος
ἐγένετο τῶν Συρακουσίων.
Ὡς οἱ Κροτωνιατῶν φυγάδες ἐπιστρατεύσαντες ἐπὶ
τὴν πατρίδα πάντες ἀνῃρέθησαν.
Ὀλυμπιάδος μετὰ τοῦ παιδὸς κάθοδος ἐπὶ τὴν βασιλείαν.
Εὐρυδίκης καὶ Φιλίππου τοῦ βασιλέως ἅλωσις καὶ
θάνατος.
Ὡς Εὐμενὴς ἔχων τοὺς ἀργυράσπιδας ἀνέβη μὲν εἰς
τὰς ἄνω σατραπείας, συνήγαγε δὲ τούς τε σατράπας καὶ
τὰς δυνάμεις εἰς τὴν Περσίδα.
Ὡς Ἄτταλος καὶ Πολέμων μετὰ τῶν συνεπιθεμένων
τῇ φυλακῇ ληφθέντες ἀνῃρέθησαν.
Ὡς Ἀντίγονος διώξας Εὐμενῆ περὶ τὸν Κοπράτην
ποταμὸν ἠλαττώθη.
Ὡς εἰς Μηδίαν ἀναζεύξας ἐν ταῖς παρόδοις πολλοὺς
ἀπέβαλε τῶν στρατιωτῶν.
Παράταξις Ἀντιγόνου πρὸς Εὐμενῆ καὶ τοὺς σατράπας
ἐν Παραιτάκοις.1
Ἀποχώρησις Ἀντιγόνου μετὰ τῆς δυνάμεως εἰς Μηδίαν
πρὸς χειμασίαν.
Κασάνδρου στρατεία εἰς Μακεδονίαν καὶ πολιορκία
Ολυμπιάδος ἐν Πύδνῃ.
