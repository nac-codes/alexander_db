Diodorus of Sicily

φυγάδων πολλοὶ συνεδεδραμήκεισαν εἰς τὴν
πόλιν, οἳ καὶ διὰ τὴν ἰδίαν ἀσφάλειαν καὶ διὰ τὸ
πρὸς τὸν τύραννον μῖσος ἐκθύμως ἠγωνίζοντο.
5καθ᾿ ὃν δὴ χρόνον ἧκον ἐκ Καρχηδόνος πρέσβεις,
οἳ τῷ μὲν Ἀγαθοκλεῖ περὶ τῶν πραχθέντων ἐπετίμησαν
ὡς παραβαίνοντι τὰς συνθήκας, τοῖς δὲ
Μεσσηνίοις εἰρήνην παρεσκεύασαν καὶ τὸ φρούριον
ἀναγκάσαντες ἀποκαταστῆσαι τὸν τύραννον ἀπέπλευσαν
6εἰς τὴν Λιβύην. ὁ δ᾿ Ἀγαθοκλῆς παρελθὼν
εἰς Ἀβάκαινον πόλιν σύμμαχον, τοὺς δοκοῦντας
ἀλλοτρίως ἔχειν τὰ πρὸς αὐτὸν ἀπέσφαξεν, ὄντας
πλείους τῶν τεσσαράκοντα.
7Ἅμα δὲ τούτοις πραττομένοις Ῥωμαῖοι μὲν διαπολεμοῦντες
Σαμνίταις Φερέντην, πόλιν τῆς Ἀπουλίας,
κατὰ κράτος εἷλον. οἱ δὲ τὴν Νουκερίαν τὴν
Ἀλφατέρναν καλουμένην οἰκοῦντες πεισθέντες ὑπό
τινων τῆς μὲν Ῥωμαίων φιλίας ἀπέστησαν, πρὸς
δὲ τοὺς Σαμνίτας συμμαχίαν ἐποιήσαντο.

At this time there came envoys from Carthage, who censured Agathocles for what he had done on the ground that he had violated the treaty. They also secured peace for the people of Messenê, and then, when they had forced the tyrant to restore the fort, they sailed back to Libya. Agathocles, however, went on to Abacaenon,1 an allied city, where he put to death those who appeared to be hostile to him, being more than forty in number.2
While these things were taking place, the Romans3 in their war with the Samnites took Ferentum, a city of Apulia, by storm. The inhabitants of Nuceria, which is called Alfaterna, yielding to the persuasion of certain persons, abandoned their friendship for Rome and made an alliance with the Samnites.4
