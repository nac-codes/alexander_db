Diodorus of Sicily
5γενησόμενόν μοι τῶν φίλων. ὅπερ καὶ πρὸς
ἀλήθειαν ἐξέβη· οἱ γὰρ ἐπιφανέστατοι τῶν φίλων
ὑπὲρ τοῦ πρωτείου διενεχθέντες πολλοὺς1 καὶ μεγάλους
ἀγῶνας συνεστήσαντο μετὰ τὴν Ἀλεξάνδρου
τελευτήν.
Τὰς δὲ συντελεσθείσας ὑπ᾿ αὐτῶν πράξεις ἡ
βύβλος αὕτη περιέχουσα ποιήσει φανερὸν τὸ ῥηθὲν
6τοῖς φιλαναγνωστοῦσιν. ἡ μὲν γὰρ πρὸ ταύτης2 βύβλος
τὰς Ἀλεξάνδρου πράξεις ἁπάσας περιείληφε
μέχρι τῆς τελευτῆς· αὕτη δὲ τὰ τοῖς διαδεξαμένοις
τὴν τούτου βασιλείαν πεπραγμένα περιέχουσα
τελευτὴν μὲν ἔχει τὸν προηγούμενον ἐνιαυτὸν
τῆς Ἀγαθοκλέους τυραννίδος, περιείληφεν δ᾿ ἔτη
ἑπτά.
2. Ἐπ᾿ ἄρχοντος γὰρ Ἀθήνησι Κηφισοδώρου
Ῥωμαῖοι μὲν κατέστησαν ὑπάτους Λεύκιον Φρούριον
καὶ Δέκιον Ἰούνιον.3 ἐπὶ δὲ τούτων Ἀλεξάνδρου
τοῦ βασιλέως τετελευτηκότος ἄπαιδος ἀναρχία
2καὶ πολλὴ στάσις ἐγένετο περὶ τῆς ἡγεμονίας. ἡ
μὲν γὰρ τῶν πεζῶν φάλαγξ Ἀρριδαῖον τὸν Φιλίππου

be my funeral games.”1 And this actually happened; 323 b.c. for after the death of Alexander the foremost of his friends quarrelled about the primacy and joined in many great combats.
This Book, which contains an account of the deeds accomplished by these friends, will make the philosopher’s saying clear to the interested reader. The preceding Book included all the acts of Alexander up to his death; this one, containing the deeds of those who succeeded to his kingdom, ends with the year before the tyranny of Agathocles and includes seven years.2
2. When Cephisodorus was archon at Athens, the Romans elected Lucius Frurius and Decius Junius consuls.3 During this term the throne was vacant, since Alexander the king had died without issue, and great contention arose over the leadership.4 The phalanx of the infantry was supporting Arrhidaeus,



1Cp. Arrian, Anabasis of Alexander, 7. 26. 3; Curtius,
10. 5. 5; Justin, 12. 15. 6–8.2Diodorus (19. 2. 1) dates the beginning of the tyranny of
Agathocles in the archonship of Demogenes, 317/16. The
events recorded in Book 18 are divided among the years of
four archons: Cephisodorus, 323/2 (chaps. 2–25); Philocles,
322/1 (chaps. 26–43); Apollodorus, 319/18 (chaps. 44–57);
and Archippus, 318/17 (chaps. 58–75). The burial of Alexander
(chaps. 26–28) and the campaign of Eumenes against Craterus (chaps. 29–32), which fill the first part of Diodorus’ narrative of 322/1, are placed by the Marmor Parium in the following year. The remaining events recorded by Diodorus as taking place in 322/1 are not mentioned in the Marmor Parium, which has no entry for 320/19. It seems impossible to determine whether the chronological confusion is due to Diodorus himself, or to one or more undiscoverable lacunae in the manuscripts. For a further discussion of this problem cp. “Note on Chronology” in the Introduction to this volume.3Cephisodorus was archon in 323/2. According to the conventional (Varronian) chronology, Lucius Furius Camillus and Decimus Junius Brutus Scaeva were consuls in 325 b.c., the former holding the office for the second time (Livy, 8. 29. 2).
