Diodorus of Sicily
Τάδε ἔνεστιν ἐν τῇ ὀκτωκαιδεκάτῃ τῶν Διοδώρου βύβλων
Ἡ γενομένη ταραχὴ καὶ στάσις μετὰ τὴν Ἀλεξάνδρου
τελευτὴν ἐν ταῖς δυνάμεσιν.
Περδίκκου παράληψις τῆς κατὰ τὴν βασιλείαν ἐπιμελείας
καὶ διαίρεσις τῶν σατραπειῶν.
Ἀπόστασις τῶν ἐν ταῖς ἄνω σατραπείαις Ἑλλήνων καὶ
ἀποστολὴ στρατηγοῦ Πίθωνος ἐπ᾿ αὐτούς.
Ἀπαγγελία τῆς κατὰ τὴν Ἀσίαν θέσεως καὶ τῶν ἐν
αὐτῇ σατραπειῶν.
Ὡς Πίθων κατεπολέμησε τοὺς ἀποστάντας Ἕλληνας.
Ὡς Ἀθηναῖοι πόλεμον ἐξήνεγκαν πρὸς Ἀντίπατρον
τὸν ὀνομασθέντα Λαμιακόν.
Ὡς Λεωσθένης ἀναδειχθεὶς στρατηγὸς καὶ συστησάμενος
δύναμιν ἐνίκησε μάχῃ τὸν Ἀντίπατρον καὶ συνέκλεισεν
εἰς πόλιν Λαμίαν.
Λεωσθένους τοῦ στρατηγοῦ τελευτὴ καὶ ἐπιτάφιος.
Παράληψις τῶν σατραπειῶν ὑπὸ τῶν μεμερισμένων
αὐτάς.
Ἱππομαχία τῶν Ἑλλήνων πρὸς Λεοννάτον καὶ νίκη
τῶν Ἑλλήνων.
Ὡς Ἀντίπατρος Λεοννάτου σφαγέντος ἐν τῇ μάχῃ
παρέλαβε τὴν Λεοννάτου δύναμιν.
