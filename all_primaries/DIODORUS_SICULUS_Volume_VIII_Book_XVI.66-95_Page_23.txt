66. When Eubulus was archon at Athens, the 345/4 b.c. Romans elected as consuls Marcus Fabius and Servius Sulpicius.1 In this year Timoleon the Corinthian, who had been chosen by his fellow-citizens to command in Syracuse, made ready for his expedition to Sicily. He enrolled seven hundred mercenaries and, putting his men aboard four triremes and three fastsailing ships, set sail from Corinth. As he coasted along he picked up three additional ships from the Leucadians and the Corcyraeans, and so with ten ships he crossed the Ionian Gulf.2
During this voyage, a peculiar and strange event


1Eubulus was archon from July 345 to June 344 b.c. Broughton (1. 131) gives the consuls of 345 b.c. as M. Fabius Dorsuo and Servius Sulpicius Camerinus Rufus.2The narrative is continued from chap. 65. There is a parallel but often differing account of these events in Plutarch, Timoleon, wherein (7. 1–3; 8. 3) the ten ships are itemized as seven Corinthian, one Leucadian, and two Corcyraean. This distinction between triremes and “fast-sailing ships” is artificial.23
