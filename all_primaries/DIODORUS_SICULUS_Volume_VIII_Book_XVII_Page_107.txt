Diodorus of Sicily
Τῶν Διοδώρου βύβλων
τῆς ἑπτακαιδεκάτης εἰς δύο διῃρημένης
ἡ πρώτη περιέχει τάδε
Ως᾿ Αλέξανδρος διαδεξάμενος τὴν βασιλείαν κατέστησε
τὰ κατὰ τὴν ἀρχήν.
Ὡς τὰ νεωτερίζοντα τῶν ἐθνῶν ἀνεκτήσατο.
Ως Θήβας κατασκάψας καὶ φόβον ἐπιστήσας τοῖς
Ἕλλησι στρατηγὸς αὐτοκράτωρ τῆς Ἑλλάδος ᾑρέθη.
Ὡς διαβὰς εἰς τὴν Ἀσίαν τοὺς σατράπας ἐνίκησε περὶ
τὸν ἐν Φρυγίᾳ Γρανικὸν ποταμόν.
Ὡς Μίλητον καὶ Ἁλικαρνασσὸν ἐξεπολιόρκησεν.
Μάχη Δαρείου πρὸς Ἀλέξανδρον ἐν Ἰσσῷ τῆς Κιλικίας
καὶ νίκη Αλεξάνδρου.
Τύρου πολιορκία καὶ Αἰγύπτου παράληψις καὶ πάροδος
εἰς Ἄμμωνα τοῦ βασιλέως.
Παράταξις ἐν Ἀρβήλοις Ἀλεξάνδρου πρὸς Δαρεῖον
καὶ νίκη Ἀλεξάνδρου.
Μάχη Ἀντιπάτρου πρὸς Λακεδαιμονίους καὶ νίκη
Ἀντιπάτρου.
Ἡ δευτέρα περιέχει τάδε
Ἀρβήλων ἅλωσις ὑπ᾿ Αλεξάνδρου καὶ κατάληψις
πολλῶν χρημάτων.
