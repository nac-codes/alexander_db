Diodorus of Sicily
Ὡς Πευκέστης ἤγαγε πρὸς Ἀλέξανδρον ἐκ τῶν Περσῶν
ἐπιλέξας τοξότας καὶ σφενδονήτας μυρίους.1
Ὡς τὰς τάξεις ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐποίησεν ἀναμίξας τοῖς
Μακεδόσι Πέρσας.
Ὡς τοῖς ἐπιγόνοις παισὶ μυρίοις οὖσι τὰς δαπάνας καὶ
παιδείας μισθοὺς ἅπασιν ἐχορήγει.
Ὡς Λεωσθένης ἤρξατο κινεῖν τὸν πρὸς Μακεδόνας πόλεμον.
Ὡς Ἀλέξανδρος ἐπὶ Κοσσαίους ἐστράτευσεν.
Ὡς πορευμένου τοῦ βασιλέως εἰς Βαβυλῶνα προεῖπον
οἱ Χαλδαῖοι τῷ Ἀλεξάνδρῳ τελευτήσειν αὐτόν, ἐὰν εἰς
τὴν Βαβυλῶνα εἰσέλθῃ.
Ὡς ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐν ἀρχῇ μὲν κατεπλάγη καὶ παρήλλαξε
τὴν Βαβυλῶνα, ὕστερον δ᾿ ὑπὸ τῶν Ἑλληνικῶν
φιλοσόφων πεισθεὶς κατήντησεν εἰς τὴν πόλιν.
Περὶ τοῦ πλήθους τῶν παραγενομένων πρεσβειῶν.
Περὶ τῆς Ἡφαιστίωνος ταφῆς καὶ τοῦ πλήθους τῶν εἰς
αὐτὴν δαπανηθέντων χρημάτων.
Περὶ τῶν σημείων τῶν γεγενημένων Ἀλεξάνδρῳ καὶ τῆς
τελευτῆς αὐτοῦ.
