ΒΙΒΛΟΣ ΕΠΤΑΚΑΙΔΕΚΑΤΗ
1.Ἡ μὲν πρὸ ταύτης βύβλος, οὖσα τῆς ὅλης
συντάξεως ἑξκαιδεκάτη, τὴν ἀρχὴν ἔσχεν ἀπὸ τῆς
Φιλίππου τοῦ Ἀμύντου βασιλείας· περιελήφθησαν
δ᾿ ἐν αὐτῇ πράξεις αἱ μὲν τοῦ Φιλίππου πᾶσαι
μέχρι τῆς τελευτῆς, αἱ δὲ τῶν ἄλλων βασιλέων τε
καὶ ἐθνῶν καὶ πόλεων ὅσαι γεγόνασι κατὰ τοὺς τῆς
βασιλείας ταύτης χρόνους, ὄντας ἐτῶν εἴκοσι καὶ
2τεσσάρων. ἐν ταύτῃ δὲ τὰς συνεχεῖς πράξεις
ἀναγράφοντες ἀρξόμεθα μὲν ἀπὸ τῆς Ἀλεξάνδρου
βασιλείας, περιλαβόντες δὲ τὰ τούτῳ τῷ βασιλεῖ
πραχθέντα μέχρι τῆς τελευτῆς συναναγράψομεν καὶ
τὰ ἅμα τούτοις συντελεσθέντα ἐν τοῖς γνωριζομένοις
μέρεσι τῆς οἰκουμένης· οὕτω γὰρ μάλιστα
ὑπολαμβάνομεν τὰς πράξεις εὐμνημονεύτους ἔσεσθαι,
κεφαλαιωδῶς τεθείσας καὶ συνεχὲς ἐχούσας
ταῖς ἀρχαῖς τὸ τέλος.
3Ἐν ὀλίγῳ δὲ χρόνῳ μεγάλας πράξεις οὗτος ὁ
βασιλεὺς κατειργάσατο καὶ διὰ τὴν ἰδίαν σύνεσίν
τε καὶ ἀνδρείαν ὑπερεβάλετο τῷ μεγέθει τῶν ἔργων
πάντας τοὺς ἐξ αἰῶνος τῇ μνήμῃ παραδεδομένους
4βασιλεῖς· ἐν ἔτεσι γὰρ δώδεκα καταστρεψάμενος
τῆς μὲν Εὐρώπης οὐκ ὀλίγα, τὴν δὲ Ἀσίαν σχεδὸν
ἅπασαν εἰκότως περιβόητον ἔσχε τὴν δόξαν καὶ
τοῖς παλαιοῖς ἥρωσι καὶ ἡμιθέοις ἰσάζουσαν. ἀλλὰ
γὰρ οὐκ ἀναγκαῖον ἡμῖν ἐν τῷ προοιμίῳ προλαμβάνειν
118Book XVII
Book XVII
1. The preceding book, which was the sixteenth of the Histories, began with the coronation of Philip the son of Amyntas and included his whole career down to his death, together with those events connected with other kings, peoples and cities which occurred in the years of his reign, twenty-four in number. In this book we shall continue the systematic narrative beginning with the accession of Alexander, and include both the history of this king down to his death as well as contemporary events in the known parts of the world. This is the best method, I think, of ensuring that events will be remembered, for thus the material is arranged topically, and each story is told without interruption.
Alexander accomplished great things in a short space of time, and by his acumen and courage surpassed in the magnitude of his achievements all kings whose memory is recorded from the beginning of time. In twelve years he conquered no small part of Europe and practically all of Asia, and so acquired a fabulous reputation like that of the heroes and demigods of old. But there is really no need to anticipate
