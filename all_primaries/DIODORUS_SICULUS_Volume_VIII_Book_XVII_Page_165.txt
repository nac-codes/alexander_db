ἀκριβῶς ἐποιήσατο.
Εὑρέθησαν δὲ πεζοὶ Μακεδόνες μὲν μύριοι καὶ
δισχίλιοι, σύμμαχοι δὲ ἑπτακισχίλιοι, μισθοφόροι

appropriate marks of respect,1 and then proceeded to 334/3 b.c. make an accurate count of his accompanying forces.
There were found to be, of infantry, twelve thousand Macedonians, seven thousand allies, and five thousand mercenaries, all of whom were under the command of Parmenion. Odrysians, Triballians, and Illyrians accompanied him to the number of seven thousand; and of archers and the so-called Agrianians one thousand, making up a total of thirty-two thousand foot soldiers. Of cavalry there were eighteen hundred Macedonians, commanded by Philotas son of Parmenion; eighteen hundred Thessalians, commanded by Callas son of Harpalus; six hundred from the rest of Greece under the command of Erigyius; and nine hundred Thracian and Paeonian scouts with Cassander in command, making a total of forty-five hundred cavalry. These were the men who crossed with Alexander to Asia.2 The soldiers who were left behind in Europe under the command

1. 11. 7.2Diodorus is our only source for the detailed troop list of
Alexander. Justin (11. 6. 2) gives simply 32,000 foot and
4500 horse; Plutarch (Alexander, 15. 1), 30,000–43,000 foot and 4000–5000 horse; Arrian (1.11.3) “not much more than” 30,000 foot and 5000 horse. Plutarch (De Fortuna aut Virtute Alexandri, 1. 3. 327 d/e) states that Aristobulus gave 30,000 foot and 4000 horse, Ptolemy 30,000 foot and 5000 horse, and Anaximenes 43,000 foot and 5500 horse. Plutarch (Alexander, 15. 1) adds that Alexander had with him only seventy talents (from Aristobulus) and provisions for thirty days (Duris), while Onesicritus stated that he was in debt in the amount of 200 talents. It will be noted that Diodorus’s figures for the cavalry add up to 5100, and not to 4500, as stated.
Diodorus correctly states that Philotas commanded the Companion Cavalry and Callas the Thessalians, but Erigyius did not get command of the Allied Cavalry until the arrest of Alexander of Lyncestis in the winter of 334/3. “Cassander” is a mistake, or he is otherwise unknown; Ariston commanded the Scouts at the Granicus and later (Berve, Alexanderreich, 2, nos. 138 and 302).165
