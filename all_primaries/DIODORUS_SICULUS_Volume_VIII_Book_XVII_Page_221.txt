Diodorus of Sicily

ἀλλὰ καὶ αὐταὶ ταύτας ἠξίουν συνεπικουρῆσαι
τοῖς ἑαυτῶν ἀκληρήμασιν.
5Οἱ δὲ τοῦ βασιλέως παῖδες καταλαβόμενοι τὴν
τοῦ Δαρείου σκηνὴν τἀκείνου λουτρὰ καὶ δεῖπνα
παρεσκευάζοντο καὶ λαμπάδων πολλὴν πυρὰν ἅψαντες
προσεδέχοντο τὸν Ἀλέξανδρον, ὅπως ἀπὸ τοῦ
διωγμοῦ γενόμενος καὶ καταλαβὼν ἑτοίμην πᾶσαν
τὴν παρασκευὴν τοῦ Δαρείου οἰωνίσηται τὴν ὅλην
τῆς Ἀσίας ἡγεμονίαν.
6Κατὰ δὲ τὴν μάχην ἐτελεύτησαν τῶν βαρβάρων
πεζοὶ μὲν πλείους τῶν δέκα1 μυριάδων, ἱππεῖς δ᾿
οὐκ ἐλάττους τῶν μυρίων, τῶν δὲ Μακεδόνων πεζοὶ
μὲν εἰς τριακοσίους, ἱππεῖς δὲ περὶ ἑκατὸν καὶ
πεντήκοντα. ἡ μὲν οὖν ἐν Ἰσσῷ τῆς Κιλικίας μάχη
τοιοῦτον ἔσχε τὸ τέλος.
37. Τῶν δὲ βασιλέων Δαρεῖος μὲν κατὰ κράτος
ἡττημένος εἰς φυγὴν ὥρμησεν καὶ μεταλαμβάνων
ἄλλον ἐξ ἄλλου τῶν ἀρίστων ἵππων κατὰ κράτος
ἤλαυνε, διαφυγεῖν σπεύδων τὰς Ἀλεξάνδρου χεῖρας
καὶ τῶν ἄνω σατραπειῶν ἅψασθαι προαιρούμενος·
2Ἀλέξανδρος δὲ μετὰ τῆς ἑταιρικῆς ἵππου καὶ τῶν
ἄλλων ἀρίστων ἱππέων ἐποιεῖτο τὸν διωγμόν,
σπεύδων ἐγκρατὴς γενέσθαι τοῦ Δαρείου. διανύσας
δὲ σταδίους διακοσίους ἀνέκαμψεν εἰς τὴν παρεμβολὴν
περὶ μέσας νύκτας, τοῖς δὲ λουτροῖς θεραπεύσας

of them, but themselves sought the assistance of the 333/2 b.c. others in their own misfortunes.
The royal pages now took over the tent of Dareius and prepared Alexander’s bath and dinner and, lighting a great blaze of torches, waited for him, that he might return from the pursuit and, finding ready for him all the riches of Dareius, take it as an omen for his conquest of the empire of all Asia.1
In the course of the battle there died on the Persian side more than one hundred thousand infantry and not less than ten thousand cavalry2; on the Macedonian side, the casualties were three hundred infantry and one hundred and fifty cavalry.3 This was the conclusion of the battle at Issus of Cilicia.
37. The kings, however, were still occupied. When he knew that he was decisively defeated, Dareius gave himself up to flight and mounting in turn one after another of his best horses galloped on at top speed, desperately seeking to escape from Alexander’s grasp and anxious to reach the safety of the upper satrapies. Alexander followed him with the companion cavalry4 and the best of the other horsemen, eager to get possession of Dareius’s person. He continued on for two hundred furlongs and then turned back, returning to his camp about midnight.




1Curtius, 3. 11. 23; Justin, 11. 10. 1–5; Plutarch, Alexander,
20. 6–8. Justin and Plutarch (21. 4) state that Alex- ander married Barsinê at this time (above, p. 183, note 2). Curthis mentions Barsinê(3. 13. 14) but not the marriage.2These same figures are given by Curthis (3. 11. 27), Plutarch (Alexander, 20. 5), and Arrian (2. 11. 8). Justin gives (11. 0. 10) 61,000 infantry and 10,000 cavalry killed and 40,000 captured.3Curthis gives 4500 wounded, 302 missing, 150 killed (3. 11. 27); Justin (11. 9. 10), 130 infantry killed and 150 cavalry; Arrian (2. 10. 7), 120 Macedonians killed.4This is the usual term for the Macedonian royal horse guards.221
