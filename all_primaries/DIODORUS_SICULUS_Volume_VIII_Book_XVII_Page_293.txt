Diodorus of Sicily
8διωγμὸν οὗτοι μὲν ἐπανῆλθον ἄπρακτοι, ὁ δὲ
Παρμενίων ταῖς τῶν Θετταλῶν εἴλαις χρώμενος
ἐμπειρότατα καὶ πολλοὺς καταβαλὼν μόλις ἐτρέψατο
τοὺς βαρβάρους, μάλιστα καταπλαγέντας τῇ
κατὰ τὸν Δαρεῖον φυγῇ.
61. Ὁ δὲ Δαρεῖος τῇ στρατηγίᾳ διαφέρων καὶ
συνεργὸν ἔχων τὸ πλῆθος τοῦ κονιορτοῦ τὴν ἀποχώρησιν
οὐχ ὁμοίαν τοῖς ἄλλοις βαρβάροις ἐποιεῖτο,
εἰς τοὐναντίον δὲ μέρος ὁρμήσας καὶ κρυπτομένην
ἔχων διὰ τὸν ἐξαιρόμενον κονιορτὸν τὴν ἰδίαν ἀποχώρησιν
ἀκινδύνως αὐτός τε διέφυγεν τούς τε μεθ᾿
ἑαυτοῦ πάντας εἰς τὰς κατόπιν κειμένας τῶν
2Μακεδόνων κώμας διέσωσε. τέλος δὲ πάντων τῶν
βαρβάρων πρὸς φυγὴν ὁρμησάντων καὶ τῶν Μακεδόνων
τοὺς ἐσχάτους ἀεὶ κτεινόντων ταχὺ πᾶς ὁ
3πλησίον τοῦ πεδίου τόπος νεκρῶν ἐπληρώθη. διὸ
καὶ τῶν βαρβάρων ἐν ταύτῃ τῇ μάχῃ κατεκόπησαν
οἱ πάντες ἱππεῖς τε καὶ πεζοὶ πλείους τῶν ἐννέα
μυριάδων· τῶν δὲ Μακεδόνων ἀνῃρέθησαν μὲν εἰς
πεντακοσίους, τραυματίαι δ᾿ ἐγένοντο παμπληθεῖς,1

distance from the battlefield they returned without 331/0 b.c. accomplishing their mission. Nevertheless Parmenion handled the Thessalian squadrons with the utmost skill and finally, killing many of the enemy, routed the Persians who were by now much disheartened by the withdrawal of Dareius.1
61. Dareius was a clever strategist. He took advantage of the great cloud of dust and did not withdraw to the rear like the other barbarians, but swinging in the opposite direction and covering his movement by the dust, got away safely himself and brought all his troops into villages which lay behind the Macedonian position.2 Finally all the Persians had fled, and as the Macedonians kept slaughtering the stragglers, before long the whole region in which the battle had taken place was covered with dead. On the Persian side in the battle fell, cavalry and infantry together, more than ninety thousand.3 About five hundred of the Macedonians were killed and there were very many wounded.4 Of the most prominent



1This incident is variously reported. According to Diodorus,
Alexander did not receive Parmenion’s plea for help,
and Parmenion extricated himself without it. According to
Curtius (4. 15. 6–8; 16. 1–4) and Plutarch (Alexander, 32.
3–4; 33. 7), Alexander received the message but did not turn
back, and Parmenion extricated himself without help. According
to Arrian (3. 15. 1), Alexander received the message,
returned, and helped Parmenion.2Diodorus is confused as to Dareius’s movements after the
battle, perhaps from a confusion of the Greater and the
Lesser Zab. He placed the battle at Arbela (chap. 53. 4), which lies between the two rivers. If Dareius made his escape up the valley of the Greater Zab, to the north, he would have moved into the Macedonian rear. Actually, of course, the battle took place at Gaugamela, in the plain north of the Greater Zab, and Dareius fled to the south to Arbela, escaping up the valley of the Lesser Zab (Curtius, 4. 16. 8; Arrian, 3. 15. 4–5). Diodorus’s repeated reference to the dust cloud may be an attempt to cover what he felt to be an inherent improbability. It is true that, accidentally or intentionally, dust played a part in many ancient battles (cp. E. Echols, Classical Journal, 47 (1952), 285–288).3This figure is given variously as 40,000 (Curtius, 4. 16. 26) and 300,000 (Arrian, 3. 15. 6). The writer of P. Oxyrhynchus
1798 gives a total of 53,000.4The Macedonian casualties are given variously as 100 (Arrian, 3. 15. 6), 300 (Curtius, 4. 16. 26), and 1000 foot and 200 horse (P. Oxyrhynchus 1798).293
