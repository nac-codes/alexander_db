Diodorus of Sicily
2ταλάντων. ταῦτα δὲ ἐκ πολλῶν χρόνων οἱ βασιλεῖς
ἄθικτα διετήρησαν, πρὸς τὰ παράλογα τῆς τύχης
ἀπολιπόντες αὑτοῖς καταφυγάς. χωρὶς δὲ τούτων
ὑπῆρχεν ἐννακισχίλια τάλαντα χρυσοῦ χαρακτῆρα
δαρεικὸν ἔχοντα.
3Ἴδιον δέ τι συνέβη γενέσθαι τῷ βασιλεῖ κατὰ τὴν
παράληψιν τῶν χρημάτων. καθίσαντος γὰρ αὐτοῦ
ἐπὶ τὸν βασιλικὸν θρόνον καὶ τούτου μείζονος ὄντος
ἢ κατὰ τὴν συμμετρίαν τοῦ σώματος, τῶν παίδων
τις ἰδὼν τοὺς πόδας ἀπολείποντας πολὺ τοῦ κατὰ
τὸν θρόνον ὑποβάθρου βαστάσας τὴν Δαρείου τράπεζαν
4ὑπέθηκε τοῖς ποσὶν αἰωρουμένοις. ἁρμοστῆς
δὲ γενομένης ὁ μὲν βασιλεὺς ἀπεδέξατο τὴν τοῦ
πράξαντος εὐστοχίαν, τῶν δὲ παρεστώτων τις τῷ
θρόνῳ εὐνοῦχος κινηθεὶς τὴν ψυχὴν τῇ μεταβολῇ
5τῆς τύχης ἐδάκρυσεν. ὃν ἰδὼν ὁ Ἀλέξανδρος
ἤρετο, Τί κακὸν ἰδὼν γεγονὸς κλαίεις; ὁ δὲ
εὐνοῦχος ἔφησε, Νῦν μὲν σός εἰμι δοῦλος, πρότερον
δὲ Δαρείου, καὶ φύσει φιλοδέσποτος ὢν ἤλγηκα
ἰδὼν τὸ παρ᾿ ἐκείνῳ μάλιστα τιμώμενον νῦν ἄτιμον
γεγονὸς σκεῦος.
6Ὁ δὲ βασιλεὺς διὰ τῆς ἀποκρίσεως λαβὼν ἔννοιαν



306Book XVII

kings had accumulated unused over a long period of 330/29 b.c. time as a protection against the vicissitudes of Fortune. In addition there were nine thousand talents of minted gold in the form of darics.1
A curious thing happened to the king when he was shown the precious objects. He seated himself upon the royal throne, which was larger than the proportions of his body.2 When one of the pages saw that his feet were a long way from reaching the footstool which belonged to the throne, he picked up Dareius’s table and placed it under the dangling legs. This fitted, and the king was pleased by the aptness of the boy, but a eunuch standing by was troubled in his heart at this reminder of the changes of Fortune and wept. Alexander noticed him and asked, “What wrong have you seen that you are crying?” The eunuch replied, “Now I am your slave as formerly I was the slave of Dareius. I am by nature devoted to my masters and I was grieved at seeing what was most held in honour by your predecessor now become an ignoble piece of furniture.”
This answer reminded the king how great a change

1Justin (11. 14. 9) and Plutarch (Alexander, 36. 1: coined
money) give the same figure as Diodorus; Curtius (5. 2. 11)
and Arrian (3. 16. 7) give 50,000 talents. The daric was the
standard Persian gold coin with an image of the king on one
side depicted as an archer. The name was popularly derived
from that of Dareius I, who first minted them (cp. E. S. G.
Robinson, Numismatic Chronicle, 18, 1958, 187–193.)2The story is told also by Curtius, 5.2. 13–15, but without
the moral tone that is striking here. It is well known that
the throne was a symbol of divinity in the Orient, and that
a king’s clothing, bed, and throne were affected with royal
and divine mana. Cp. S. Eitrem, Symbolae Osloenses, 10 (1932), 35; R. Labat, Le Caractère religieux de la royauté assyro-babylonienne (1939); P. Schramm, Herrschaftszeichen und Staatssymbolik, 1 (1954), 316–369; G. Germain, Revue des Études Grecques, 69 (1956), 303–313; S. Weinstock, Journal of Roman Studies, 47 (1957), 146–154. This may explain why it was hybris for Alexander to put his feet on the royal table, but not why the throne was so high. A. Alföldi (La Nouvelle Clio, 1950, 537), however, points out that Persian thrones were normally elevated seven steps up, and this one may have lacked its steps. Probably Diodorus’s source did not rationalize the anecdote. Curtius (8. 4. 15–17) reports that Alexander mentioned this sanctity of the throne, saying that he did not believe in it. Cp. also the second throne incident, chap. 116. 2–4. See Addenda.307
