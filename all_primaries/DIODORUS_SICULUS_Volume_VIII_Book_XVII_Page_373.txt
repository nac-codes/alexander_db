Diodorus of Sicily

Ἀλέξανδρος τήν τε βασιλείαν ἀπέδωκεν αὐτῷ καὶ
τὸ λοιπὸν διετέλει τούτῳ φίλῳ καὶ συμμάχῳ χρώμενος
καὶ μετωνόμασεν αὐτὸν Ταξίλην.
Ταῦτα μὲν οὖν ἐπράχθη κατὰ τοῦτον τὸν ἐνιαυτόν.
87. Ἐπ᾿ ἄρχοντος δ᾿ Ἀθήνησι Χρέμητος Ῥωμαῖοι
κατέστησαν ὑπάτους Πόπλιον Κορνήλιον καὶ
Αὖλον Ποστούμιον. ἐπὶ δὲ τούτων Ἀλέξανδρος ἐν
τῇ Ταξίλου χώρᾳ προσαναλαβὼν τὴν δύναμιν
ἐστράτευσεν ἐπὶ Πῶρον τὸν τῶν πλησιοχώρων
2Ἰνδῶν βασιλέα. οὗτος δ᾿ εἶχε πεζοὺς μὲν πλείους
τῶν πεντακισμυρίων, ἱππεῖς δὲ περὶ τρισχιλίους,
ἅρματα δὲ πλείω τῶν χιλίων, ἐλέφαντας δὲ ἑκατὸν
καὶ τριάκοντα. ἐπεποίητο δὲ καὶ ἕτερον τῶν πλησιοχώρων
βασιλέα σύμμαχον, ὃς ὠνομάζετο Ἐμβίσαρος,
εἶχε δὲ δύναμιν οὐ πολὺ λειπομένην τῆς
τοῦ Πώρου.
3Ὁ δὲ Ἀλέξανδρος ἀκούσας τοῦτον τὸν βασιλέα
τετρακοσίους ἀπέχειν σταδίους ἔκρινε πρὸ τῆς τούτου
4παρουσίας ἐπιβαλεῖν τῷ Πώρῳ. ἐγγίσαντος
δὲ αὐτοῦ τοῖς Ἰνδοῖς ὁ Πῶρος πυθόμενος πλησίον
εἶναι τοὺς πολεμίους εὐθὺς ἐξέταξε τὴν δύναμιν καὶ
τοὺς μὲν ἱππεῖς ἐπὶ τὰ κέρατα διεμέρισεν, τοὺς δ᾿
ἐλέφαντας καταπληκτικῶς κεκοσμημένους κατὰ

restored his kingdom to him and thereafter held him 327/6 b.c. as a friend and ally. He also changed his name to Taxiles.1
That is what happened in that year.
87. In the archonship of Chremes at Athens, the 326/5 b.c. Romans elected as consuls Publius Cornelius and Aulus Postumius.2 In this year Alexander repaired his army in the land of Taxiles and then marched against Porus, the king of the neighbouring Indians.3 He had more than fifty thousand infantry, about three thousand cavalry, more than a thousand chariots of war, and one hundred and thirty elephants.4 He had enlisted the support of a second king of the neighbouring regions, whose name was Embisarus5; he had an army little smaller than that of Porus.
When Alexander received word that this king was four hundred furlongs away, he decided to attack Porus before the arrival of his ally. As he approached the Indians, Porus learned of his advance and deployed his forces promptly. He stationed his cavalry upon both flanks, and 



1The same story is told by Curtius, 8. 12. 4–18. The adhesion
of Taxiles is briefly noted in Arrian, 5. 3. 5–6, and told
in a different manner by Plutarch, Alexander, 59. 1–3.2Chremes was archon at Athens from July 326 to June
325 b.c. The consuls of 328 b.c. are not entirely certain
(Broughton 1. 145). One was C. Plautius Decianus or P.
Plautius Proculus, the other P. Cornelius Scapula or P.
Cornelius Scipio Barbatus. No Postumius is otherwise attested
at this time. According to the calculations of M. J.
Fontana, Kokalos, 2 (1956), 42 f., the battle with Porus took
place about July 326 b.c., as Diodorus dates it, while Arrian (5. 19. 3) places the battle a little earlier, in the Attic month Munichion of the year of Hegemon (April/May of 326 b.c). He states, however, that the time was after the summer solstice (Arrian, 5. 9. 4).3For the whole story cp. Curtius, 8. 13–14; Justin, 12. 8. 1-7; Plutarch, Alexander, 60; Arrian, 5. 3. 5–19. 3. Diodorus (like Justin) omits the exciting story of Alexander’s crossing the Hydaspes River.4Curtius (8. 13. 6) gives Porus’s strength as 30,000 foot, 300 chariots, and 85 elephants; Plutarch (Alexander, 62. 1) as 20,000 foot and 2000 horse. Arrian (5. 15. 4) gives 4000 horse, 300 chariots, 200 elephants, and 30,000 foot.5He is otherwise known as Abisares (Arrian, 5. 22. 2; Curtius, 8. 13. 1; 14. 1). Diodorus calls him by another name in chap. 90. 4 (Berve, Alexanderreich, 2, no. 2).373
