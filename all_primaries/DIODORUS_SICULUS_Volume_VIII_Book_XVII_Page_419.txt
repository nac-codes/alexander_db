Diodorus of Sicily

σῶμα τοῦ Πτολεμαίου κατέπλασε καὶ πιεῖν δοὺς
ὑγιῆ κατέστησε.
Γνωσθείσης δὲ τῆς εὐχρηστίας καὶ οἱ λοιποὶ
τυχόντες τῆς ὁμοίας θεραπείας διεσώθησαν. τὴν
δὲ πόλιν τῶν Ἁρματηλίων, οὖσαν ὀχυρὰν καὶ
μεγάλην, ἐπεβάλετο μὲν πολιορκεῖν, τῶν δ᾿ ἐγχωρίων
ἀπαντησάντων μεθ᾿ ἱκετηριῶν καὶ παραδόντων
ἑαυτοὺς ἀπέλυσεν αὐτοὺς τῆς τιμωρίας.
104. Αὐτὸς δὲ καταπλεύσας εἰς τὸν Ὠκεανὸν
μετὰ τῶν φίλων καὶ δύο νήσους ἐνταῦθα κατιδὼν
ἔθυσεν ἐν αὐταῖς τοῖς θεοῖς1 μεγαλοπρεπῶς καὶ
πολλὰ μὲν ἐκπώματα καὶ μεγάλα χρυσᾶ2 κατεπόντισε
ταῖς σπονδαῖς συναφιείς, βωμοὺς δὲ Τηθύος
καὶ Ὠκεανοῦ κατασκευάσας ὑπέλαβεν τετελευτηκέναι
τὴν προκεχειρισμένην στρατείαν. ἀναζεύξας
δ᾿ ἐντεῦθεν εἰς τοὐπίσω διὰ τοῦ ποταμοῦ παρέπλευσεν
2εἰς Πάταλα,3 πόλιν ἐπίσημον. αὕτη δὲ
τὴν πολιτείαν εἶχε διατεταγμένην ὁμοίως τῇ
Σπάρτῃ· ἀπὸ δύο γὰρ οἴκων ἐν αὐτῇ διεδέχοντο
δύο βασιλεῖς, αἰεὶ τῶν κατὰ πόλεμον ἡγούμενοι
πραττομένων, τὸ4 δὲ τῶν γερόντων ἀρχεῖον τῶν
ὅλων προειστήκει.

also prepared an infusion of the plant and gave 326/5 b.c. Ptolemy a drink of it. This restored him to health.1
Now that the value of the remedy had been demonstrated, all the other wounded received the same therapy and became well. Then Alexander prepared to attack and capture the city of Harmatelia, which was large and strongly fortified, but the inhabitants came to him with suppliant branches and handed themselves over. He spared them any punishment.
104. Now he resumed his voyage down the river and sailed out into the Ocean with his Friends.2 There he discovered two islands3 and on them performed rich sacrifices.4 He threw many large cups of gold into the sea following the libations which he poured from them. He erected altars to Tethys and Oceanus5 and judged that his projected campaign was at an end. Setting sail from there, he proceeded back up the river to Patala, a fine city.6 It had a government organized very much like that of Sparta. Two kings descended from two houses inherited their office from their fathers. They had charge of all arrangements concerning war, while the council of elders was the principal administrative body.7
1Arrian’s failure to mention this incident, favourable as it
is to Ptolemy, raises some question as to whether Ptolemy
included it in his history. It is mentioned also by Strabo,
15. 2. 7. 723.2According to Plutarch, Alexander, 66. I, the voyage had taken seven months. It was now the summer of 325 b.c. (Strabo, 15. 1. 17).3One was in the river, one outside (Arrian, 6. 19. 3–4). Plutarch, Alexander, 66. 1, mentions only one island.4To Poseidon and to the gods whom Ammon had designated (Arrian, 6. 19. 4–5). No gods named (Curtius, 9. 9. 27; Justin, 12. 10. 4; Plutarch, Alexander, 66. 1).5Justin (12. 10. 6) mentions “aras.”6Arrian, 6. 20. 1. This was about the rising of the Dog Star, or mid-July 325 (Strabo, 15. 1. 17. 692).7Only Arrian (6. 20. 2–5) at this point mentions Alexander’s voyage down to the Rann of Kutch.419
