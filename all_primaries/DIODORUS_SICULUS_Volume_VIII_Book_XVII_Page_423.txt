Diodorus of Sicily

ἐγένετο πολλῶν μυριάδων. τῇ δὲ τῶν ἐθνῶν τούτων
ἀπωλείᾳ πάντες οἱ πλησιόχωροι περίφοβοι
γενόμενοι προσεχώρησαν τῷ βασιλεῖ.
8Ὁ δ᾿ Ἀλέξανδρος παρὰ θάλατταν ἐφιλοτιμήθη
κτίσαι πόλιν καὶ1 λιμένα μὲν εὑρὼν ἄκλυστον,
πλησίον δ᾿ αὐτοῦ τόπον εὔθετον ἔκτισεν ἐν αὐτῷ
πόλιν Ἀλεξάνδρειαν.
105. Εἰς δὲ τὴν τῶν Ὠρειτῶν2 χώραν διὰ τῶν
παρόδων παρεισελθὼν ταχέως ἅπασαν ὑπήκοον
ἐποιήσατο. οἱ δὲ Ὠρεῖται3 τὰ μὲν ἄλλα παραπλήσια
τοῖς Ἰνδοῖς ἔχουσιν, ἓν δὲ ἐξηλλαγμένον
2καὶ παντελῶς ἄπιστον. τῶν γὰρ τελευτησάντων
παρ᾿ αὐτοῖς τὰ σώματα ἐκφέρουσιν4 οἱ συγγενεῖς
γυμνοὶ λόγχας ἔχοντες, εἰς δὲ τοὺς ἐπὶ τῆς χώρας
δρυμοὺς θέντες τὸ σῶμα τὸν μὲν περικείμενον τῷ
νεκρῷ κόσμον περιαιροῦνται, τὸ δὲ σῶμα τοῦ
τετελευτηκότος καταλείπουσι βορὰν5 τοῖς θηρίοις·
τὰς δ᾿ ἐσθῆτας διελόμενοι θύουσι τοῖς κατὰ γῆν
ἥρωσι καὶ τῶν οἰκείων ὑποδοχὴν ποιοῦνται.
3Μετὰ δὲ ταῦθ᾿ ὁ Ἀλέξανδρος προῆγεν ἐπὶ τὴν
Κεδρωσίαν,6 παρὰ θάλατταν τὴν πορείαν ποιούμενος,
καὶ κατήντησεν εἰς ἔθνος ἄξενον καὶ παντελῶς
4θηριῶδες. τούς τε γὰρ ὄνυχας οἱ τῇδε

persons killed reached many myriads. By the destruction 326/5 b.c. of these tribes, all their neighbours were terrified and submitted to the king.
Alexander wanted to found a city by the sea. He found a sheltered harbour with suitable terrain near by, and established there a city called Alexandria.1
105. He advanced into the country of the Oreitae through the passes and quickly brought it all into submission.2 These Oreitae have the same customs as the Indians in other respects, but have one practice which is strange and quite unbelievable. The bodies of the dead are carried out by their relatives, who strip themselves naked and carry spears. They place the bodies in the thickets which exist in the country and remove the clothing from them, leaving them to be the prey of wild beasts. They divide up the clothing of the dead, sacrifice to the heroes of the nether world, and give a banquet to their friends.3
Next Alexander advanced into Cedrosia, marching near the sea, and encountered a people unfriendly and utterly brutish.4 Those who dwelt here let the nails

(Arrian, 6. 22. 3).2Arrian, 6.22. 1–2. Bare mention in Plutarch, Alexander, 66. 2.3This story is not otherwise told in this connection, but is of a type which is located in northern Iran. Onesicritus (Jacoby, Fragmente der griechischen Historiker, no. 134, F 5; Strabo, 11. 11.3) told that the Bactrians and Sogdians threw out their sick and elderly to be devoured by dogs, but that Alexander stopped the practice. Plutarch twice refers to this institution. In De Fortuna aut Virtute Alexandri,, 1. 5. 328 c, he says that Sogdians kill their parents, while the Scythians eat them. In Can Vice Cause Unhappiness? 3. 499 d, he reports that the dead were devoured by dogs among the Hyrcanians, and by birds among the Bactrians (also Cicero, Disp. Tusc. 1. 45. 108). For other instances cp. Strabo, 11. 11. 3. 517; 8. 520; 15. 1. 56. 710; 62. 714.4Curtius, 9. 10. 8–10; Arrian, 6. 23. 1–3.423
