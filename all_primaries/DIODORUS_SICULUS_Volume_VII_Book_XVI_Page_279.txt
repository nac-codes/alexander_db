Diodorus of Sicily

ἐνεδείξατο· διόπερ ἐν ταῖς μετὰ ταῦτα πράξεσιν
ἀεὶ συναγωνιστὰς ἔσχεν οὐ μόνον αὐτός, ἀλλὰ καὶ
μετὰ ταῦτα ὁ υἱὸς Ἀλέξανδρος.
3Τῶν δὲ συγγραφέων Δημόφιλος μὲν ὁ Ἐφόρου
τοῦ ἱστοριογράφου υἱὸς τὸν παραλειφθέντα πόλεμον
ὑπὸ τοῦ πατρός, ὀνομασθέντα δὲ ἱερόν, συντεταγμένος
ἐντεῦθεν ἦρκται ἀπὸ τῆς καταλήψεως τοῦ
ἐν Δελφοῖς ἱεροῦ καὶ τῆς συλήσεως τοῦ μαντείου
ὑπὸ Φιλομήλου τοῦ Φωκέως· ἐγένετο δ᾿ ὁ πόλεμος
οὗτος ἔτη ἕνδεκα ἕως τῆς φθορᾶς τῶν διανειμαμένων
4τὰ ἱερὰ χρήματα. Καλλισθένης δὲ τὴν
τῶν Ἑλληνικῶν πραγμάτων ἱστορίαν γέγραφεν ἐν
βύβλοις δέκα καὶ κατέστροφεν εἰς τὴν κατάληψιν
τοῦ ἱεροῦ καὶ παρανομίαν Φιλομήλου τοῦ Φωκέως·
5Δίυλλος δ᾿ ὁ Ἀθηναῖος ἦρκται τῆς ἱστορίας ἀπὸ
τῆς ἱεροσυλήσεως καὶ γέγραφε βύβλους εἴκοσι καὶ
ἕξ,1 συμπεριλαβὼν πάσας τὰς ἐν τοῖς χρόνοις τούτοις
γενομένας πράξεις περί τε τὴν Ἑλλάδα καὶ
τὴν Σικελίαν.
15. Ἐπ᾿ ἄρχοντος δ᾿ Ἀθήνησιν Ἐλπίνου Ῥωμαῖοι

Wherefore in the course of subsequent events not 357/6 b.c.. merely Philip himself but his son Alexander after him had the Thessalians always as confederates.
Among historians Demophilus,1 the son of the chronicler Ephorus, who treated in his work the history of what is known as the Sacred War, which had been passed over by his father, began his account with the capture of the shrine at Delphi and the pillaging of the oracle by Philomelus the Phocian. This war lasted eleven years2 until the annihilation of those who had divided amongst themselves the sacred property. And Callisthenes3 wrote the history of the events in the Hellenic world in ten books and closed with the capture of the shrine and the impious act of Philomelus the Phocian. Diyllus4 the Athenian began his history with the pillaging of the shrine and wrote twenty-six books, in which he included all the events which occurred in this period both in Greece and in Sicily.
15. When Elpines was archon at Athens the Romans 356/5 b.c.
1From chap. 76. 5 we learn that the work of Ephorus was
in thirty books and that it closed with the capture of Perinthus.
What Demophilus probably wrote was book 30, since
books 28 and 29 (fr. 149–150) contained the history of the
West and book 27 (fr. 148) contained the early years of
Philip’s reign. See Beloch, Griechische Geschichte2, 3. 2. 25
and Athenaeus, 6. 232 d.2Compare for the beginning and end chaps. 23. 1 (355/4)
and 59. 1 (346/5). The Sacred War is accorded ten years by Aeschines (2. 131; 3. 148); Pausanias (9. 6. 4); was said to be closed in the tenth year by Duris (fr. 2); Pausanias (10. 3. 1).3Of Olynthus, the nephew and pupil of Aristotle. He wrote the history of the Sacred War probably as a sequel to his Hellenica (see Book 14. 117. 8). Cp. Beloch, Griechische Geschichte2, 3. 2. 25 and 12. He was war reporter to Alexander.4Much uncertainty reigns as to the number and arrangement of the books of his history. The usual reading of the editors here, 27, conflicts with 26 in Book 21. 5. Beloch (op. cit. 3. 2. 26) believes 27 in this passage correct and 26 In Book 21. 5 a scribal error. Ruhl in Neue Jahrbücher für Philologie, 137 (1888), 123 ff. thinks Diyllus wrote a history in three parts, συντάξεις of 27 books, nine in each part, beginning with the Sacred War and ending with the death of Cassander.279
