δῃουμένην ὑπὸ τῶν πολεμίων οὐκ ἐκαρτέρουν,
ἀλλὰ τοῖς θυμοῖς προπίπτοντες1 ἐξεπήδων ἐκ τῆς
πόλεως· κωλυόμενοι δ᾿ ὑπὸ τῶν πρεσβυτέρων
προϊέναι μακρότερον ἀπὸ τῆς πατρίδος, μή τις
ἐπίθηται, ἐπείσθησαν τὴν ἡσυχίαν ἄγειν καὶ τῇ
2πόλει παρέχεσθαι τὴν ἀσφάλειαν. τῶν δὲ περὶ
τὸν Ἐπαμεινώνδαν διὰ τοῦ Ταϋγέτου καταβαινόντων
ἐπὶ τὸν Εὐρώταν, καὶ διαβαινόντων τὸν
ποταμὸν σφοδρὸν ὄντα τῷ ῥεύματι κατὰ τὴν χειμερινὴν
ὥραν, ὁρῶντες οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι τεταραγμένην
τὴν δύναμιν τῶν ἐναντίων διὰ τὴν χαλεπότητα
τῆς διαβάσεως, καιρὸν ἔλαβον εὔθετον πρὸς τὴν
ἐπίθεσιν, καὶ τὰς μὲν γυναῖκας καὶ παῖδας, ἔτι δὲ
καὶ τοὺς γεγηρακότας, ἀπέλιπον ἐν τῇ πόλει φυλάττοντας
τὴν Σπάρτην, αὐτοὶ δὲ πανδημεὶ συντάξαντες
τοὺς νέους ἐξεχύθησαν ἐπὶ τοὺς πολεμίους,
καὶ προσπεσόντες ἄφνω τοῖς διαβαίνουσι πολὺν

καὶ τῶν Ἀρκάδων, καὶ τῷ πλήθει κυκλούντων
τοὺς ἐναντίους, οἱ Σπαρτιᾶται πολλοὺς ἀνῃρηκότες
ἐπανῆλθον εἰς τὴν πόλιν, φανερῶς ἐνδεδειγμένοι
4τὰς ἰδίας ἀνδραγαθίας. μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα τῶν περὶ

συνεργὸν ἔχοντες τὴν τῶν τόπων ὀχυρότητα, πολλοὺς

τέλος δ᾿ οἱ πολιορκοῦντες πᾶσαν εἰσενεγκάμενοι
σπουδὴν τὸ μὲν πρῶτον ἀπείκαζον βίᾳ χειρώσασθαι4
τὴν Σπάρτην· ἐπεὶ δὲ τῶν βιαζομένων οἱ μὲν

Now Epameinondas descended through the Taygetus1 into the Eurotas valley and was engaged in crossing the river, whose current was swift since it was the winter season, when the Lacedaemonians, seeing their opponents’ army thrown into confusion by the difficulty of the crossing, seized the opportunity favourable for attack. Leaving the women, children, and the old men as well in the city to guard Sparta, they marshalled in full force the men of military age, streamed forth against the enemy, fell upon them suddenly as they crossed, and wrought heavy slaughter. But as the Boeotians and Arcadians fought back and began to encircle the enemy with their superior numbers, the Spartans, having slain many, withdrew to the city, for they had clearly displayed their own courage. Following this, as Epameinondas in full force made a formidable assault on the city, the Spartans with the aid of their strong natural defences slew many of those who pressed rashly forward, but finally the besiegers applied great pressure and thought at first they had overcome Sparta by force; but as those who tried to force their way were some slain, some wounded, Epameinondas recalled the soldiers with the trumpet, but the men of their
