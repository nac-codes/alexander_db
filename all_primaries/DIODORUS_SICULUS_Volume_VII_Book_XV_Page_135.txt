τὴν χώραν καὶ1 ἀνοικοδομήσας2 ἀνέσωσε πόλιν
ἐπίσημον Ἑλληνίδα καὶ μεγάλης ἀποδοχῆς ἔτυχε
παρὰ πᾶσιν ἀνθρώποις.
2Οὐκ ἀνοίκειον δ᾿ εἶναι νομίζω, πολλάκις τῆς
Μεσσήνης ἁλούσης καὶ κατασκαφείσης, τὰ περὶ
αὐτὴν ἀπ᾿ ἀρχῆς ὡς ἐν κεφαλαίοις παραδραμεῖν.
τὸ μὲν οὖν παλαιὸν οἱ ἀπὸ Νηλέως καὶ Νέστορος
κατέσχον αὐτὴν μέχρι τῶν Τρωικῶν χρόνων, μετὰ
δὲ ταῦθ᾿ ὁ3 Ἀγαμέμνονος Ὀρέστης καὶ οἱ ἀπὸ
τούτου μέχρι τῆς καθόδου τῶν Ἡρακλειδῶν, ἀπὸ
δὲ ταύτης Κρεσφόντης ἔλαχε τὴν Μεσσηνίαν
μερίδα, καὶ οἱ ἀπὸ τούτου μέχρι τινὸς ἐβασίλευσαν
αὐτῆς· ὕστερον δὲ τῶν ἀπὸ Κρεσφόντου τὴν βασιλείαν
ἀποβαλόντων Λακεδαιμόνιοι κύριοι κατέστησαν
3αὐτῆς. μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα Τηλέκλου τοῦ βασιλέως
τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων ἀποθανόντος ἐν ἀγῶνι κατεπολεμήθησαν
ὑπὸ Λακεδαιμονίων οἱ Μεσσήνιοι.
τοῦτον δὲ τὸν πόλεμον εἰκοσαετῆ φασι γενέσθαι,
κατομοσαμένων τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων μὴ ἀνακάμψειν4
εἰς τὴν Σπάρτην, ἐὰν μὴ Μεσσήνην ἕλωσιν.
τότε δὲ5 συνέβη τοὺς παρθενίας ὀνομασθέντας γεννηθῆναι
καὶ κτίσαι τὴν τῶν Ταραντίνων πόλιν.

he divided the land, and reconstructing its buildings 369/8 b.c. restored a notable Greek city and gained the widespread approbation of all men.1
Here I think it not unsuitable, since Messenê has so often been captured and razed, to recapitulate its history2 from the beginning. In ancient times the line of Neleus and Nestor3 held it down to Trojan times; then Orestes, Agamemnon’s son, and his descendants down to the return of the Heracleidae4; following which Cresphontes5 received Messene as his portion and his line ruled it for a time; but later when Cresphontes’ descendants had lost the kingship, the Lacedaemonians became masters of it. After this, at the death of the Lacedaemonian king Teleclus,6 the Messenians were defeated in a war by the Lacedaemonians. This war is said to have lasted twenty years, for the Lacedaemonians had taken an oath not to return to Sparta unless they should have captured Messene. Then it was that the children called partheniae7 were born and founded the city of Tarentum.

Apparently Xenophon, the Spartophile, could not bring himself
to mention the refounding of Messenê.2A brief account of the early history of Messenê and Sparta is to be found in Holm, The History of Greece, 1, 193–201.
