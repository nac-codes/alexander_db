Diodorus of Sicily

προσήγετο καὶ πᾶσιν ἐχρῆτο φιλανθρώπως, ἐκκαλούμενος
τοὺς Σικελιώτας πρὸς εὔνοιαν. καὶ
Καμαριναῖοι μὲν καὶ Λεοντῖνοι, πρὸς δὲ τούτοις
Καταναῖοι καὶ Ταυρομενῖται παραχρῆμα πρέσβεις
4ἐκπέμψαντες προσέθεντο Καρχηδονίοις· μετ᾿ ὀλίγας
δ᾿ ἡμέρας οἵ τε Μεσσήνιοι καὶ Ἀβακαινῖνοι1 καὶ
συχναὶ τῶν πόλεων ἀλλήλας φθάνουσαι πρὸς Ἀμίλκαν
ἀφίσταντο· τοσαύτη τοῖς ὄχλοις ἐνέπεσεν ὁρμὴ
μετὰ τὴν ἧτταν διὰ τὸ πρὸς τὸν τύραννον μῖσος.
5ὁ δ᾿ Ἀγαθοκλῆς ἀπαγαγὼν2 τὴν ὑπολελειμμένην
δύναμιν εἰς Συρακούσσας τὰ πεπονηκότα τῶν τειχῶν
ἐπεσκεύαζε καὶ τὸν ἀπὸ τῆς χώρας σῖτον ἀπεκόμιζε,
διανοούμενος τῆς μὲν πόλεως τὴν ἱκανὴν
ἀπολιπεῖν φυλακήν, τῆς δὲ δυνάμεως τὴν κρατίστην
μετάγειν εἰς Λιβύην καὶ μετατιθέναι τὸν πόλεμον
εἰς τὴν ἤπειρον ἐκ τῆς νήσου.
Ἡμεῖς δὲ κατὰ τὴν ἐν ἀρχῇ πρόθεσιν τὴν εἰς
Λιβύην Ἀγαθοκλέους διάβασιν ἀρχὴν ποιησόμεθα
τῆς ἑπομένης βίβλου.

and very many of the other cities vied with each other in deserting to Hamilcar, for such was the desire that came upon the common people after the defeat because of their hatred of the tyrant. But Agathocles conducted what survived of his army to Syracuse, repaired the ruined parts of the walls, and carried off the grain from the countryside, intending to leave an adequate garrison for the city, but with the strongest part of his army to cross to Libya and transfer the war from the island to the continent.
But we, following the plan laid down at the beginning,1 will make Agathocles’ expedition into Libya the beginning of the following book.
