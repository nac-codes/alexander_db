Diodorus of Sicily

ἔδωκεν, οὓς ἔφασαν ὀφείλεσθαι παρὰ Λυσιμάχου,
4καὶ δωρεαῖς ἐτίμησε. καθ᾿ ὃν δὴ χρόνον
ἦλθε καὶ Σέλευκος ἐκ τῶν ἄνω σατραπειῶν διαβεβηκὼς
εἰς Καππαδοκίαν μετὰ πολλῆς δυνάμεως
καὶ κατασκευάσας στεγνὰ τοῖς στρατιώταις παρεχείμαζεν.1
εἶχε δὲ πεζοὺς μὲν εἰς δισμυρίους,
ἱππεῖς δὲ σὺν τοῖς ἱπποτοξόταις περὶ μυρίους
δισχιλίους, ἐλέφαντας δὲ ὀγδοήκοντα πρὸς τοῖς
τετρακοσίοις, ἅρματα δὲ δρεπανηφόρα πλείω τῶν
ἑκατόν.
5Αἱ μὲν οὖν τῶν βασιλέων δυνάμεις τοῦτον τὸν
τρόπον ἠθροίζοντο, κεκρικότων ἁπάντων κατὰ τὴν
ἐπιοῦσαν θερίαν διὰ τῶν ὅπλων κρῖναι τὸν πόλεμον.
ἡμεῖς δέ, καθάπερ ἐν ἀρχῇ προεθέμεθα, τὸν γενόμενον
τούτοις τοῖς βασιλεῦσι πρὸς ἀλλήλους πόλεμον
περὶ τῶν ὅλων πράξεων ἀρχὴν ποιησόμεθα
τῆς ἑπομένης βίβλου.

At this time Seleucus also arrived, having crossed over from the upper satrapies into Cappadocia with a large army, and after making huts for the soldiers he went into winter quarters near by. He had foot-soldiers to the number of about twenty thousand, about twelve thousand horsemen including his mounted archers, four hundred and eighty elephants, and more than a hundred scythed chariots.
In this way, then, the forces of the kings were being gathered together, since they all had determined to decide the war by force of arms during the coming summer. But, as we proposed in the beginning, we shall make the war that these kings waged against each other for supreme rule the beginning of the following book.
