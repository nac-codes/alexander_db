Βιθυνῶν χώρας ἐξίησιν ἐς τὸν Εὔξεινον πόντον.
ἐνταῦθα καὶ Ἀθηναίων πρεσβεία παρ᾿ Ἀλέξανδρον
ἀφίκετο, δεόμενοι Ἀλεξάνδρου ἀφεῖναί σφισι τοὺς
αἰχμαλώτους, οἳ ἐπὶ Γρανίκῳ ποταμῷ ἐλήφθησαν
Ἀθηναίων ξυστρατευόμενοι τοῖς Πέρσαις καὶ τότε
ἐν Μακεδονίᾳ ξὺν τοῖς δισχιλίοις δεδεμένοι ἦσαν·
6καὶ ὑπὲρ αὐτῶν ἄπρακτοι ἐν τῷ τότε ἀπῆλθον.
οὐ γὰρ ἐδόκει ἀσφαλὲς εἶναι Ἀλεξάνδρῳ ἔτι
ξυνεστῶτος τοῦ πρὸς τὸν Πέρσην πολέμου ἀνεῖναί
τι τοῦ φόβου τοῖς Ἕλλησιν, ὅσοι ἐναντία τῇ
Ἑλλάδι στρατεύεσθαι ὑπὲρ τῶν βαρβάρων οὐκ
ἀπηξίωσαν· ἀλλ᾿ ἀποκρίνεται, ἐπειδὰν τὰ παρόντα
καλῶς γένηται, τότε ἥκειν ὑπὲρ τῶν αὐτῶν
πρεσβευομένους.
118Anabasis of Alexander I

runs through Bithynian Thrace into the Black Sea.333 b.c. An embassy also arrived there from Athens, begging Alexander to let them have the Athenian prisoners captured at the Granicus fighting on the Persian side and now under chains in Macedonia with the 2,000 captives. Their request on the prisoners’6 behalf was not granted for the time being, and they departed.5 Alexander did not think it safe, with the Persian war still in progress, to relax intimidation of the Greeks who did not scruple to fight for the barbarians against Greece; but he answered that when circumstances were favourable they were to approach him again on the same subject.
5Cf. iii 6, 2, Introd. n. 69. QC. iii 1, 9 says he now (apparently before arrival at Gordium) promised to restore all Greeks to their homes at the end of the war.119
