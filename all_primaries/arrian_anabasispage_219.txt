ὅστις πρῶτος αἱρήσει τὸ τεῖχος· καὶ αἱρεῖ πρῶτος
Νεοπτόλεμος τῶν ἑταίρων τοῦ Αἰακιδῶν γένους·
ἐπὶ δὲ αὐτῷ ἄλλαι καὶ ἄλλαι τάξεις ὁμοῦ τοῖς
7ἡγεμόσιν ἀνέβαινον. ὡς δὲ ἅπαξ παρῆλθόν τινες
ἐντὸς τοῦ τείχους τῶν Μακεδόνων, κατασχίσαντες
ἄλλας καὶ ἄλλας πύλας, ὅσαις ἕκαστοι ἐπετύγχανον,
δέχονται εἴσω τὴν στρατιὰν πᾶσαν. οἱ δὲ Γαζαῖοι
καὶ τῆς πόλεώς σφισιν ἤδη ἐχομένης ξυνεστηκότες
ὅμως ἐμάχοντο, καὶ ἀπέθανον πάντες αὐτοῦ μαχόμενοι
ὡς ἕκαστοι ἐτάχθησαν· παῖδας δὲ καὶ
γυναῖκας ἐξηνδραπόδισεν αὐτῶν Ἀλέξανδρος. τὴν
πόλιν δὲ ξυνοικίσας ἐκ τῶν περιοίκων ἐχρῆτο ὅσα
φρουρίῳ ἐς τὸν πόλεμον.
218Anabasis of Alexander II

some claim to distinction for their courage, which 332 b.c. would take the wall first; the first was Neoptolemus, one of the Companions and of the family of the Aeacidae. After him, battalion after battalion went up with their officers. As soon as some of the7 Macedonians had got inside the wall they tore down gate after gate, as they came to them, and admitted the entire army. The Gazaeans held together and continued to resist, though their city was already in enemy hands; and all perished there, fighting each man at his post. Alexander sold their women and children into slavery, populated the city from the surrounding tribesmen and used it as a fortress town for the war.2
2For other ‘native’ foundations by Al. cf. iv 28, 4; vi 17, 4; Ind. 40, 7 f.; perhaps vi 22, 3 (cf. QC. ix 10, 7); QC. ix 10, 3; n. on A. iii 24,5. QC. iv 6, 31 here says that after the capture Al. despatched Amyntas to levy reinforcements in Macedon; for their arrival cf. A. iii 16, 10. Probably A. omitted this item, which would have been in his source.219
