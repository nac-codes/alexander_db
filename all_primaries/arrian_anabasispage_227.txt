πολλὰ μὲν καὶ ἄλλα ἀληθεῦσαι ἐλέγετο Ἀλεξάνδρῳ,
φάναι εὐδαίμονα ἔσεσθαι τὴν πόλιν τά τε
ἄλλα καὶ τῶν ἐκ γῆς καρπῶν εἵνεκα.
3Ἐν τούτῳ δὲ καὶ Ἡγέλοχος κατέπλευσεν εἰς
Αἴγυπτον καὶ ἀπαγγέλλει Ἀλεξάνδρῳ Τενεδίους τε
ἀποστάντας Περσῶν σφίσι προσθέσθαι (καὶ γὰρ
καὶ ἄκοντας Πέρσαις προσχωρῆσαι) καὶ Χίων ὅτι
δὴ ὁ δῆμος ἐπηγάγετο σφᾶς βίᾳ τῶν κατεχόντων
τὴν πόλιν, οὓς Αὐτοφραδάτης τε καὶ Φαρνάβαζος
4ἐγκατέστησαν· ἁλῶναι δὲ αὐτόθι καὶ Φαρνάβαζον
ἐγκαταληφθέντα καὶ Ἀριστόνικον Μηθυμναῖον τὸν
τύραννον ἐσπλεύσαντα ἐς τὸν λιμένα τῆς Χίου ξὺν
ἡμιολίαις λῃστρικαῖς πέντε, ὑπὸ σφῶν ἐχόμενον
τὸν λιμένα οὐ γνόντα, ἀλλ᾿ ἐξαπατηθέντα γὰρ πρὸς
τῶν τὰ κλεῖθρα ἐχόντων τοῦ λιμένος, ὅτι τὸ
5Φαρναβάζου ἄρα ναυτικὸν ὁρμεῖ ἐν αὐτῷ· καὶ τοὺς
μὲν λῃστὰς πάντας αὐτοῦ κατακοπῆναι πρὸς σφῶν,
Ἀριστόνικον δὲ ἦγε παρὰ Ἀλέξανδρον καὶ
Ἀπολλωνίδην τὸν Χῖον καὶ Φησῖνον καὶ Μεγαρέα
καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους, ὅσοι τῆς τε ἀποστάσεως τῆς
Χίων ξυνεπελάβοντο καὶ ἐν τῷ τότε τὰ πράγματα
6τῆς νήσου βίᾳ εἶχον· καὶ Μιτυλήνην δὲ Χάρητα
ἔχοντα ὅτι ἀφείλετο καὶ τὰς ἄλλας τὰς ἐν Λέσβῳ
πόλεις καὶ αὐτὰς ὁμολογίᾳ προσηγάγετο, Ἀμφοτερὸν
δὲ σὺν ἑξήκοντα ναυσὶν ἐπὶ Κῶ ἔπεμψεν·
ἐπικαλεῖσθαι γὰρ σφᾶς τοὺς Κῴους· καὶ αὐτὸς
καταπλεύσας ὅτι εὗρε τὴν Κῶ πρὸς Ἀμφοτεροῦ
7ἤδη ἐχομένην. καὶ τοὺς μὲν ἄλλους ὅσοι αἰχμάλωτοι
ἦγεν Ἡγέλοχος, Φαρνάβαζος δὲ ἀπέδρα ἐν
Κῷ λαθὼν τοὺς φύλακας. Ἀλέξανδρος δὲ τοὺς
τυράννους μὲν τοὺς ἐκ τῶν πόλεων ἐς τὰς πόλεις
πέμπει χρήσασθαι ὅπως ἐθέλοιεν, τοὺς δὲ ἀμφὶ
226Anabasis of Alexander III

made many other correct prophecies to Alexander, 332-1 b.c. reflecting upon this, said that the city would be prosperous in general, but particularly in the fruits of the earth.
Hegelochus now arrived by sea in Egypt and reported3 to Alexander that the people of Tenedos had revolted from the Persians and come over to them (in fact they had joined the Persians against their will) and that the people of Chios had brought his forces into the city, in spite of the men occupying it, installed by Autophradates and Pharnabazus; Pharnabazus4 had been caught and captured there, with Aristonicus of Methymna, the tyrant, who had sailed into the harbour of Chios with five pirate frigates, unaware that the Macedonians were in possession of the harbour, for he had been misled by the assertion of the men in control of the boom to the harbour, that Pharnabazus’ fleet was anchored there; the pirates5 had all been cut down by his own men, but he had brought Aristonicus to Alexander, with Apollonides the Chian and Phesinus and Megareus and the rest of those who had assisted the revolt of the Chians, and who were for the time ruling the island by force. He6 reported also that he had captured Mitylene from Chares, and had won over by agreement the other cities in Lesbos as well. He had sent Amphoterus with sixty ships to Cos on appeal from the people of Cos, and had sailed himself to Cos and found it already in the possession of Amphoterus. All the7 remaining captives Hegelochus brought with him, except Pharnabazus, who had slipped his guards in Cos and escaped. Alexander sent the tyrants to the cities from which they came, to be treated as the citizens pleased; but the Chians with Apollonides
