ἀκοντισταὶ οἱ προτεταγμένοι τῆς ἵππου τῶν
ἑταίρων· τὰ δὲ τῶν ῥυτήρων ἀντιλαμβανόμενοι
τούς τε ἀναβάτας κατέσπων καὶ τοὺς ἵππους
6περιϊστάμενοι ἔκοπτον. ἔστι δὲ ἃ καὶ διεξέπεσε
διὰ τῶν τάξεων· διέσχον γάρ, ὥσπερ παρήγγελτο
αὐτοῖς, ἵνα προσέπιπτε τὰ ἅρματα· καὶ ταύτῃ
μάλιστα ξυνέβη αὐτά τε σῶα καὶ οἷς ἐπηλάθη
ἀβλαβῶς διελθεῖν· ἀλλὰ καὶ τούτων οἵ τε ἱπποκόμοι
τῆς Ἀλεξάνδρου στρατιᾶς καὶ οἱ ὑπασπισταὶ οἱ
βασιλικοὶ ἐκράτησαν.
14. Ὡς δὲ Δαρεῖος ἐπῆγεν ἤδη τὴν φάλαγγα
πᾶσαν, ἐνταῦθα Ἀλέξανδρος Ἀρέτην μὲν κελεύει
ἐμβαλεῖν τοῖς περιϊππεύουσι τὸ κέρας σφῶν τὸ
2δεξιὸν ὡς ἐς κύκλωσιν· αὐτὸς δὲ τέως μὲν ἐπὶ
κέρως τοὺς ἀμφ᾿ αὑτὸν ἦγε, τῶν δὲ ἐκβοηθησάντων
ἱππέων τοῖς κυκλουμένοις τὸ κέρας τὸ δεξιὸν
παραρρηξάντων τι τῆς πρώτης φάλαγγος τῶν
βαρβάρων ἐπιστρέψας κατὰ τὸ διέχον καὶ ὥσπερ
ἔμβολον ποιήσας τῆς τε ἵππου τῆς ἑταιρικῆς καὶ
τῆς φάλαγγος τῆς ταύτῃ τεταγμένης ἦγε δρόμῳ τε
3καὶ ἀλαλαγμῷ ὡς ἐπὶ αὐτὸν Δαρεῖον. καὶ χρόνον
μέν τινα ὀλίγον ἐν χερσὶν ἡ μάχη ἐγένετο· ὡς δὲ οἵ

εὐρώστως ἐνέκειντο ὠθισμοῖς τε χρώμενοι
καὶ τοῖς ξυστοῖς τὰ πρόσωπα· τῶν Περσῶν
κόπτοντες, ἥ τε φάλαγξ ἡ Μακεδονικὴ πυκνὴ καὶ
ταῖς σαρίσσαις πεφρικυῖα ἐμβεβλήκει ἤδη αὐτοῖς,
καὶ πάντα ὁμοῦ τὰ δεινὰ καὶ πάλαι ἤδη φοβερῷ
ὄντι Δαρείῳ ἐφαίνετο, πρῶτος αὐτὸς ἐπιστρέψας
ἔφευγεν· ἐφοβήθησαν δὲ καὶ οἱ περιϊππεύοντες τῶν

had been stationed in front of the Companion cavalry, 331 b.c. met them with volleys; and then they snatched hold of the reins, pulled down the drivers, and crowding round the horses, cut them down. Some did pass6 right through the Greek lines, which, as they had been ordered, parted where the chariots attacked; this was the main reason why the chariots passed through unscathed and the troops against which they were launched were unharmed. These chariots too were overpowered by the grooms of Alexander’s army and the royal hypaspists.5
14. When Darius now attacked all along the line, Alexander ordered Aretas to charge the Persian cavalry which was riding round his right wing to encircle it; he himself for a short time led on his army2 in column;1 but when the cavalry, sent off to attack the Persians who were encircling the right wing, had in some degree broken the front of the Persian phalanx, he wheeled towards the gap, and making a wedge2 of the Companion cavalry and the part of the phalanx stationed there, led them on at the double with a loud battle cry straight at Darius. Now for a3 little time it became a hand-to-hand fight, but when the cavalry with Alexander, and Alexander himself, pressed vigorously, shoving the Persians and striking their faces with their spears, and the Macedonian phalanx, solid and bristling with its pikes, had got to close quarters with them, and Darius, who had now long been in a panic, saw nothing but terrors all around, he was himself the first to turn and flee. The Persians who were trying on horseback to
