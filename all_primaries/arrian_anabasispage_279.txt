Σούσων Μάζαρον τῶν ἑταίρων καὶ στρατηγὸν
Ἀρχέλαον τὸν Θεοδώρου, προὐχώρει ὡς ἐπὶ
Πέρσας· ἐπὶ θάλασσαν δὲ κατέπεμψεν ὕπαρχον
10Συρίας καὶ Φοινίκης καὶ Κιλικίας Μένητα. καὶ
τούτῳ ἔδωκεν ἀργυρίου τάλαντα ἐς τρισχίλια
φέρειν ἐπὶ θάλασσαν, καὶ ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν ἀποστεῖλαι
παρ᾿ Ἀντίπατρον ὅσων ἂν δέηται Ἀντίπατρος ἐς
τὸν πρὸς Λακεδαιμονίους πόλεμον. ἐνταῦθα καὶ
Ἀμύντας ὁ Ἀνδρομένους ξὺν τῇ δυνάμει ἀφίκετο,
11ἣν ἐκ Μακεδονίας ἦγε. καὶ τούτων τοὺς μὲν
ἱππέας ἐς τὴν ἵππον τὴν ἑταιρικὴν κατέταξεν
Ἀλέξανδρος, τοὺς πεζοὺς δὲ προσέθηκεν ταῖς
τάξεσι ταῖς ἄλλαις, κατὰ ἔθνη ἑκάστους ξυντάξας.
κατέστησε δὲ καὶ λόχους δύο ἐν ἑκάστῃ ἴλῃ, οὐ
πρόσθεν ὄντας λόχους ἱππικούς, καὶ λοχαγοὺς
ἐπέστησε τοὺς κατ᾿ ἀρετὴν προκριθέντας ἐκ τῶν
ἑταίρων.
278Anabasis of Alexander III

Archelaus son of Theodorus as general; and then he 331 b.c. advanced against the Persians.10 He sent down Menes to the sea as hyparch of Syria, Phoenicia and Cilicia,11 and gave him up to three thousand silver10 Talents to take to the sea, from which he was to despatch to Antipater whatever Antipater required for the Lacedaemonian war.12 There too Amyntas son of Andromenes arrived with the troops he brought from Macedon.13 Of these Alexander assigned the11 horsemen to the Companion cavalry, and attached the foot to the other battalions, assigning them in accordance with their national origins. He also formed two companies in each squadron of cavalry (there had formerly been no cavalry companies), and as company-captains he appointed men distinguished for courage among the Companions.14
10Cf. QC. v 2, 16 f., replacing Mazarus by Xenophilus,
perhaps his successor (cf. D. xix 17, 3; 18, 1; 48, 6), naming
Callicrates as treasurer and giving garrison force of 3,000.11D. 64, 5 makes Apollodorus and Menes ‘generals’ of
Babylon and of the other provinces as far as Cilicia; QC. v
1, 43 gives this with the names in reverse order, wrongly
since Apollodorus was certainly in Babylonia. A modern view
that Menes was a financial official has no support in the evidence.
As a former bodyguard (ii 12, 2), he was certainly of
high rank. Hence ‘hyparch’ is most naturally construed as
‘satrap’, cf. i 12, 8 n. Did he then succeed Asclepiodorus
and perhaps Menon too in Syria (iii 6, 8 n)—the former
had certainly been superseded by 327 (iv 13, 4)—and Balacrus
in Cilicia (ii 12, 2), who was killed fighting there at some
unknown date in Al’s lifetime (D. xviii 22, 1)? So Bosworth,
CQ 1975. Against this, in iv 7, 2 (see note) Asclepiodorus is
still described as a hyparch in 329/8 b.c., when he brought
reinforcements to Al. Perhaps Menes had a general control over the satrapies of Syria, Phoenicia and Cilicia, especially as D. and QC. both say that he was given power (like Apollodorus) to levy troops, probably to provide the reinforcements for Al. that arrived from Cilicia and Syria in 330–328 b.c. (QC. v 7, 12; vii 10, 11 f., cf. A. iv 7, 2), as well as a special responsibility to send money to Antipater (D. and QC. give the sum entrusted to him as 1000 Talents). On Bosworth’s own view Phoenicia did not lie in the satrapy of Asclepiodorus; QC. iv 7, 9 says that Philotas (Berve no. 806, otherwise unknown) was put in charge of the area round Tyre, cf. also the fiscal post of Coeranus (A. iii 6, 4). No more is heard of Menes unless in iv 7, 2. On Al’s death new satraps were appointed in both Syria and Cilicia; their immediate predecessors are unknown (D. xviii 3).12Appendix VI.13Cf. ii 27 n. D. 65, 1 makes him arrive on the march to Susa, QC. v 1, 39 ff. at Babylon, with 6,000 foot and 500 horse from Macedon, 3,500 foot and 600 horse from Thrace, 4,000 foot and 380 horse from Peloponnese; some discrepancies in D., who adds 50 Macedonian pages.14Different military changes en route Babylon-Susa in QC. v 2, 2–7, cf. D. 65, 2.279
