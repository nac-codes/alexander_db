the Granicus is crucial for the whole value of his history of Alexander.
6. Certainly Pt. and Ar. were apologists for Al. and capable of disguising or distorting the truth. Sheer mendacity on matters of common knowledge was surely not in their manner. What purpose would it have served here? They were not averse to telling that Al. could show caution (i 18; 20, 1; iii 9, 4) and craft (i 20, 5 f.; 27, 7; iv 3, 2; 26, 3); the suggestion by Lane Fox that ‘cunning at dawn seemed less dashing in retrospect’ can thus not explain the wilful perversion of the truth with which he taxes them. In fact, P. shows that Al’s decision to attack at once was criticized as foolhardy. The writer whom D. followed, who was no less of an admirer of Al., perhaps thought it best to meet the charge by denying the facts on which it was based; since the ‘vulgate’ is full of fictions, it is not surprising to find another here. Pt. or Ar. or both met the criticism by inserting Al’s own justification of his conduct in the debate with Parmenio. Now this debate may well have been private, and here invention could have had free scope. Parmenio is often traduced in our sources, perhaps by the malignity of Callisthenes (App. IX; X 2; XI 4). We may, if we choose, believe that the debate is unhistoric (which is not to say that Pt. and Ar. knew it to be such). But it would have been very maladroit for its inventor both to claim falsely that Alexander attacked without delay and that Parmenio advised the course that in reality Al. took. Those who knew the truth about the battle could then easily accept the debate and infer that Al. was saved by Parmenio from his own imprudence. It would have

been better to have suppressed Parmenio’s advice (cf. D’s account) or even to have made Parmenio advise instant attack and give Al. the credit for waiting, cf. i 18.

Naval Operations 334–332
1. In 334 Al. had 160 ships (A. i 11, 6); the manuscripts of D. 17, 2 give 60, which may be amended to 160; J. xi 6, 2 has 182, presumably in error. QC. iv 5, 14 gives the same number of 160 for the fleet when reassembled in 332. Al. was able to cross the Hellespont unopposed, as the Persian fleet had not mobilized in time. When it appeared off Miletus, A. i 18, 5 says that it comprised about 400 ships. This may be an over-estimate. D. (29, 2; 31, 3) gives 300 in 333, not contradicted by A. ii 13, 4 which refers to the 100 best sailers. In 332 at Tyre Al. was joined by 120 Cypriote and 80 Phoenician ships (ii 20, 1–3), while Tyre is plausibly said to have had 80 (D. 41, 1). A Persian total of 300 ships is reasonable. In any event it is clear that in 334 it was vastly superior to Al’s. We are told that partly on this account, partly for lack of money to pay the crews (cf. i 11, 3 n.), Al. disbanded his fleet (A. i 20; D. 22, 5), except for a few, including 20 from Athens, which he kept to transport siege-engines (D. 1.c.). The last point seems absurd; how could he venture to send artillery by sea, when the ships might be sunk or captured by the superior Persian forces? Surely the Athenian ships were
