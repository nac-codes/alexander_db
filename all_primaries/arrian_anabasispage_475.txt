6. After 332 we hear of Al’s real or alleged claim to be son alternatively of Ammon (iv 9, 9; vii 8, 3; P. 27. 5; 50, 6) or of Zeus (iv 8, 2; vii 2, 2; 29, 3; P. 27, 5; 28, 2; cf. C. in P. 33, 1) or of a god (vi 14, 2); QC. consistently writes ‘son of Jupiter’, i.e. Zeus, but then he also equates Jupiter and ‘Hammon’ (iv 7, 5), a common Latin practice. The equation of Ammon and Zeus was normal, both for Amun of Egyptian Thebes, and for the god at Siwah, whose cult was held to be derived from Thebes (Hdt. ii 42, 54–7), rightly in the view of many modern scholars (F. Chamoux, Cyrène sous la Monarchic des Battiades 56). The coins of Cyrene clearly identify Ammon and Zeus (ib. 329 ff.), just as Pindar (Pythians iv 28; fr. 36) and Herodotus (ii 55; iii 25) had done. Under the Ptolemies Thebes itself was renamed Diospolis, the city of Zeus (cf. RE. s.v. Ammon; Diod. i 15; Fraser, Ptolemaic Alexandria ch. v n. 24; for other such equations of Greek and Egyptian gods ib. nn. 30, 36, 50, 56, 150, 173 and in particular for that of Osiris or Serapis with Dionysus, ib. vol. i pp. 206, 255 f.; cf. also App. IV 4 above). Callisthenes, reported without demur by Strabo, makes the priest at Siwah impersonate or interpret Zeus (§ 2 f.). It would have been perfectly natural for Al. too to identify Ammon with Zeus.
7. It is true that Greeks referred to Ammon at times in ways which might suggest that they distinguished two gods, (a) The god worshipped at Siwah is normally called Ammon, not Zeus. But the Greeks had no name for Siwah; the oracle there is ‘that in Ammon’ (Strabo xvii 1, 43), and just as they would speak of men going to Delphi or Dodona for oracular

help, so they spoke of going to Ammon. (b) Ammon as such had his cults in Athens and elsewhere in Greece by Alexander’s time (C. J. Classen, Historia 1959, 349 ff.). That does not prove that the votaries distinguished Ammon from Zeus. Men could not be sure of a god’s true name, cf. Aeschylus,
Agamemnon 160 if. with Fraenkel’s note ad loc., and E. Norden, Agnostos Theos 144 ff., nor whether other peoples might not have surer access to him; hence in religious acts it might be prudent to address him by more than one name, or to worship him with foreign rites, using his foreign name. Hence Al. himself swore both by Zeus of the Greeks and by Ammon of the Libyans (Nearchus, Ind. 35, 8) and regularly sacrificed to Ammon (vi 3, 1). To Al. the Greek and Macedonian god, Zeus, was ruler of gods and men, the supreme god, as doubtless was Ammon to the people of Siwah, and he means to invoke the supreme god who is at once Zeus to Greeks and Ammon to Libyans. Even writers like Herodotus, who expressly
identified Zeus and Ammon, could speak at times of Ammon (especially when they refer to the oracle) and at times of Zeus.
8. Al. prayed the gods for aid, εἴπερ ὄντως Διόθεν ἐστι γεγονώς (P. 33, 1). This statement in the official history cannot have been false (contra Tarn ii 352, cf. App. IX 5). But what does it mean? The word εἴπερ can signify either ‘if’ or ‘since’, but as the formulation resembles such a Homeric prayer as we have in Odyssey IX 529, and Al. was influenced by Homer, I think that ‘since’ is to be preferred, and we should not infer that Al. had any doubt about the relation to Zeus he referred to. The words Διόθεν γεγονώς are more naturally construed to mean ‘son
