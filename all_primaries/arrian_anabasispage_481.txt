Appendix VI
The revolt of agis
1. In 331 b.c. (cf. infra) king Agis of Sparta raised a formidable revolt against Macedon in Greece; to this, and to Agis’ earlier activities, Arrian makes only brief allusions; and his reticence demands an explanation. Our chief sources are D. 62 f.; QC. vi 1 (though most of his account is lost); J. xxi 1; Aeschines iii 165 and Dinarchus i 34. Athens stood aloof, but in the Peloponnese Sparta was joined by her traditional allies, the Arcadians (except Megalopolis), the Achaeans (except Pellene) and Elis; Agis is said by D. to have mustered 20,000 foot and 2,000 horse; he defeated a Macedonian force under Corragus and besieged Megalopolis, while Antipater was long in collecting an army to meet him (Aeschines), no doubt because he was at first preoccupied by a revolt in Thrace (D., who makes Memnon, the governor, its leader; this is mysterious and not easily believed, as Memnon later took reinforcements to Al., cf. QC. ix 3, 21, and Al. was not one to pardon disloyalty). Ultimately, Antipater mobilized 40,000 men, including Greek allies (D.) and defeated and

killed Agis near Megalopolis. The strength of his army is remarkable; in 334 he had been left only 12,000 Macedonian foot and 1,500 horse (D. 17, 5), and more Macedonians had been later sent east (Introd. 57, cf. §3 below), but probably available manpower was growing every year (cf. Griffith, G. & R. 1965, 129 ff.), and of course we do not know how many allies joined him. After his victory Antipater referred the punishment of Sparta to the allied synedrion, and that body in turn left the
decision to Al. (D. 73, 5 f.). Aeschines tells that Spartan representatives were about to go up to Al. and plead their case, when he was speaking; that was in July/Aug. 330 (cf. iii 254). By then the revolt was over, but Aeschines does not show just when it was suppressed. If the decisive battle be placed in autumn 331, we can readily assume that the synedrion did not meet till the Isthmian festival in late spring or early summer 330 and that the Spartans were slow in despatching their emissaries. The date of the revolt’s outbreak is also disputed, and here A’s allusions are crucial.
2. A. ii 13, 4 ff. tells how Agis met the Persian admirals on Siphnos just when the news of Issus came through (Oct. 333), that he received 30 Talents and 10 triremes from them, which he gave his brother to use in Crete, and that he later rejoined Autophradates at Halicarnassus, but he neglects his later activity in Crete, where in 332 he was winning over cities (D. 48, 1; QC. iv 1, 39 f.), and probably securing mercenaries; in the war he allegedly had 10,000 (Dinarchus), and according to D. and QC. 8,000 survivors of Issus had joined him in Crete. This estimate is incompatible with A’s statement that
