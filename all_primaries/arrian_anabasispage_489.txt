marches; Pliny (l.c., cf. vi 44 f.) cites them for distances, and they were apparently also used by Eratosthenes (c. 285–194 b.c.) for his great geographical work; see Jacoby nos. 119–23 with bibliography (cf. L. Pearson, Historia iii 439 ff.) Figures are particularly liable to corruption by copyists, and Pliny (vi 62) noticed that there were already variants in manuscripts at his disposal; some discrepancies between the totals produced by adding up the individual figures in Pliny or Strabo and those which each author supplies himself, and perhaps between particular figures in Pliny and Strabo, may be due to manuscript corruption. Pliny gives figures in Roman miles, but shows in vi 45 that he has converted stades into miles at 8: 1. Unfortunately the stade is itself a unit of measurement based on the foot, and the length of the ‘foot’ varied in different Greek systems, but in general the stade seems to be •185 km for our purposes. To some extent such data can be controlled by the distances on modern routes, though the modern route need not correspond exactly to the ancient. For a day’s march we can also adduce the experience of modern unmechanized armies. Clausewitz (cf. Marsden, Campaign of Gaugamela 19) set the average at 16 km a day, see J. Kromayer, Hermes 1896, 96 ff., for a wealth of comparative material; this applies indeed only to large armies, of the size Al. had at least until he left Ecbatana (cf. 7 below), and to significant distances; for several days even a large army can move faster, but it must then pause, to rest and let stragglers come up. In hard mountain country or intense heat or cold such a rate will be less easy to maintain. And Al. often had to pause for another reason: to collect provisions for further advance, especially when he had

3. On the basis of mileage we may calculate that starting from Gordium in May 333 (i 29, 4 n.) Al. should have reached Tarsus early in July; nearly three months elapsed before Issus (ii 11, 10 n.), and though part of this interval was filled by his long illness (P. 19, 1), about a fortnight was spent on the visit to Soli, west of Tarsus, and in operations based
