that the day of 21 September was occupied with sacrifices (and no doubt with allaying alarm caused by the eclipse), cf. iii 7, 6.

Sept.21Sacrifices
22–24Three days’ advance (7, 7)
25Contact with enemy (7, 7–9, 1)
26–9Four days’ rest (9, 1)
30Renewed advance (night of 29th, 9, 2)
Oct.1Battle (for night of 30 Sept./l Oct., 10–11).

Here, for once, we have a full record derived ultimately from the bematists. QC. also had information from the same source; he too knew of the four days’ rest after contact had been made (iv 10, 10–15) and of the postponement of the battle by a day (iv 13), but he makes Al. set out from the Tigris at the second watch of 20/21 Sept., the eclipse having occurred at the first(!), and make contact with the enemy at daybreak of the 21st (10, 1–9). We must not interpret A’s time-table from him, especially in view of the fiction of 10, 18–12, 2.
6. Al. took 20 days to cover 370 easy km from Babylon to Susa (A. iii 16, 7); we might allow as many for c. 400 km from Gaugamela to Babylon; there he stayed 34 days (QC. v 1, 36–9, cf. D. 64, 5). But conceivably he moved very fast to Babylon and stayed so long, partly to let his rear come up; even so, he can hardly have reached Susa before c. 5 December. After perhaps a short pause he crossed the mountains to Persepolis about 70 km NE of Shiraz; Eratosthenes’ estimate of 4,200 stades from Susa (Strabo xv 3, 1) is grossly excessive, if correctly recorded, but the true distance is c. 590 km and he cannot have

arrived, even though he eventually had with him only a relatively small and quick moving force (iii 18, 2), before early January 330 (cf. § 7). QC. v
6, 11 ff. records a punitive expedition in the surrounding country with snow still on the ground ‘about the setting of the Pleiads’, visible perhaps in late March rather than in late April (Borza n. 29). P. 37, 3 says that he remained at Persepolis for 4 months; if that means (parts of) 4 calendar months, he can have left in late April. The need to procure supplies (in winter) and to await the time when snow or mud would less impede his marching can account for so long a delay. It is a hard march of 700 km from Persepolis to Ecbatana (Hamadan), where he can hardly have arrived till early June; A. iii 19 supplies incomplete data, but till he was 3 days’ march from Hamadan, he did not know that he would have no battle to fight, and could not risk dividing his army or wearying it by forced marches. QC. v 13, 2 makes him by-pass Hamadan, pursuing Darius on the direct route from Arak to Teheran, but A. shows that this is an error; Radet guesses that at this point he did divide his army, which would now have been safe, and that part took that route. Al. himself certainly went to Hamadan. If Darius had already gathered in supplies and then left them behind in hurried flight, he will not have needed to stay there long to collect provisions, and if he left Persepolis on (say) 25 April and Hamadan on 9 June, the average rate of progress would be 16 km a day.
7. Al. left Hamadan with a much smaller army, and probably beyond Rhagae he regularly divided it into detachments (App. XIII), as he no longer had to
