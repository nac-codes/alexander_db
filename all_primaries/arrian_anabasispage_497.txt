have revealed a city 32 km west of Damghan, not far from the main road, which has been identified with Hecatompylos by Hansman, on the very site where von Stahl guessed it would be found. If Hansman is right, Al’s pursuit would seem to have covered not much more than 300 km in six days, or more if a pause is admitted in Choarene. This is easier to credit. However, Hansmans identification is based partly on the statements of Apollodorus of Artemita (first century b.c.) ap. Strabo xi 9, 1 that Rhagae was 500 stades from the Caspian Gates and Hecatompylos 1,260 further on; Hansman suggested that the stade must be taken as ∙163 km here, since the true distance from Rhagae to the end of the defiles is 82 km, and that Hecatompylos had to be roughly where he was to find it. He wrongly invoked as well Pliny’s estimate of 133 miles from the Gates, which at 8 stades to the mile is only 1,064 stades; this does not fit Hansman’s site, and must be an error on any view, like Ammianus’ 1,040 (xxxiii 6, 43). Marquardt would read 233 miles (= 1,860 stades) and this would then nearly agree with Eratosthenes’ figure of 1960 in our manuscripts of Strabo xi 8, 9 (also amended by Marquardt to 1860); Strabo gives no indication that the distance was in dispute. Eratosthenes is also reported there to have given the distance of Hecatompylos to Alexandria in Areia (Herat) as 4,530 (Pliny vi 61 gives 4,600) and of the Caspian Gates to Alexandria as 6,400. Hecatompylos lay on the route, and the sum of the distances is really 6,490, if the figures are correct; on Marquardt’s emendation, which gives 6,390, Strabo’s 6,400 is closer as a round sum and, being equivalent to 1,182 km with the stade at ∙185 km, nearer to the distance by the modern road (about 1,130 km).

this suggests that the figure of 1,260 km is a copyist’s error, that Hansman’s city is not Hecatompylos, which should have lain further east, and that it is unjustified to take the stade as ∙163 km, an equation which does not yield possible results elsewhere (§ 13) and which is not necessary to account for the 500 stades, a round figure, from Rhagae to the Caspian Gates; even if Apollodorus’ stade is ∙185 km it is only 10 km too high. Thus Radet may be right on the length of the pursuit of Darius, though not about the number of days it occupied; we should add two or three of rest in Choarene.
10. On any view Darius’ death falls early in July, and by mid-July, after a rest at Hecatompylos, Al. should have been ready to march into Hyrcania. A. (iii 23, 4; 25, 1) mentions a four-day wait in one camp, and a rest for 15 days at Zadracarta, the capital, which has been variously and uncertainly identified with Sari (which would fit best as base for the Mardian campaign, but cf. § 11) or Astrabad; QC. (vi 4, 8) confirms the first wait, gives additional topographical details, which von Stahl held to be accurate, and makes the Mardian campaign end on the fifth day (5, 22); this well illustrates how each writer is excerpting from much fuller data. Neither tells how much time in all was spent in Hyrcania, but it cannot have been less than a month. The country is exceptionally rich (iii 23, 1 n.), and once again Al. must have been provisioning himself for his march ‘to Bactria’ (24, 4). He cannot have started before mid-August.
11. His route took him within about 600 stades from Artacoana, the capital of Areia (25, 6). No one doubts that this town, like the city of Alexandria he
