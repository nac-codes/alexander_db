Kandahar (647), Kalat-i-Ghilzai (785) and Ghazni (1,010); figures in brackets show distances in km from Herat. I believe that Kiepert in his atlas rightly marked this as Al’s route. Strabo (xv 2, 10) says that he reached the territory of the Parapamisadae, then covered in snow, about the setting of the Pleiads, i.e. in mid or late November (cf. § 21), and wintered in the place where he founded Alexandria ‘under Caucasus’ (§ 14); A. iii 28, 1–4 refers more vaguely to deep snow, and fails to mention his winter quarters. Deep snow is most likely round Ghazni, where the climate is far harsher than either to the south or to the north. Ghazni may have been in the satrapy of Arachosia rather than of Parapamisus, but Strabo could have been thinking in geographical, not administrative terms; here Al. was in the heart of the mountains so named. Leaving Herat in early October, he could have reached Ghazni at the season named by Strabo, if he had taken the direct route and (to allow for rests) marched at the remarkably fast average rate of 35 km a day. But Strabo’s statement must be false, if we take him by the kind of detour south of Farah which most scholars since Kiepert prefer, extending to near the Seistan or Helmund lake; for instance, Fischer makes him traverse 810 km. between Farah and Kandahar instead of 377. Moreover this detour seems without purpose, and I cannot discover good reasons for assuming it. Nothing prevents us from supposing that Drangiane then extended as far north as Farah and that the Ariaspians lived round about the Farah-Kandahar road; if they did not, then it would be best to hold that Al. never entered their land, and that they sent ambassadors with their submission, as the Gadrosians (A. iii 28, 1) must have done.

13. Turn now to the distances given by Strabo and Pliny. With a stade of ∙185 km, Strabo’s 6,490 stades from the Caspian Gates to Herat are 70 km too many by modern measurements, though the excess falls to 50, if we emend to 6,390 (§ 9). With a stade of ∙163 km, the distance is about 70 km too small. Since ancient routes may well have taken slightly different courses, either discrepancy is acceptable. But, though our manuscripts of Pliny give a larger distance between Hecatompylos and Herat than Strabo, this does not compensate for the lower figure from the Gates to Hecatompylos; the sum of the figures (708 miles = 5,664 stades) is much too low, another reason for Marquardt’s emendation (§ 9). From Herat to Prophthasia we have variants, 1,500, 1,592 or 1,600 stades, i.e. 280–296 km. (If the stade were ∙163 km, the equation would be 245–260 km.) This clearly points to Prophthasia being at or near Farah, 270 km from Herat, contra Droysen 216 with wrong distance. These correspondences encourage us to expect light on Al’s later route. But difficulties appear. I give Strabo’s figures, with Pliny’s (converted into stades) in brackets, and equivalents in km for Strabo’s, taking the stade under A to be ∙185 km and under B to be ∙163 km. (It will emerge that the second equivalent is impossible.)
