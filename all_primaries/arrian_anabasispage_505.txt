There is often more in QC., esp. vii 5, 1 ff; 6, 1 ff. (better than A. iii 30, 10); 11, 1 ff. (better than A. iv 18, 4 ff.); viii 2, 19 ff. Von Schwarz shows that here again he must be following a good first hand source. Except by allusion in iii 30, 6, A. has nothing on the fearful hardships of the crossing of the Hindu-Kush (QC. vii 4, 22–5) and of the waterless route from Balkh to the Oxus (ib. 5, 1 ff.). In general (but cf. iii 28, 8 f.; iv 21, 10) he tends to suppress evidence of the risks Al. took with his men, see commentary on vi 22 ff.
16. In spring 329 Al. with the snow still thick (A. iii 28, 8) crossed the Hindu-Kush in 15 (Strabo xv 2, 10), 16 (D. 83, 1) or 17 (QC. vii 3, 21) days; perhaps the whole march took longer, and different writers took different views of the time spent in the actual pass. The usual descent lay via Chulum or Tashkurgan (Aornos), but perhaps because Bessus expected Al. here and had ravaged the country (A. iii 28, 7), Al. came down at Drapsaca (Adrapsa in Strabo), i.e. Kunduz, and then proceeded to Bactra, a great trading centre and in the heart of a fertile land (Strabo ii 1, 14; xv 1, 18; QC. 3, 26 ff), where he must have stayed some time, resting his men and getting in supplies, as it was high summer when he advanced to the Oxus (Amu-Darya) at Khelif; QC’s distance, c. 74 km at a stade of ∙185 km, is about right and his description admirable (5, 1 ff.). A. iii 29, 3 is accurate on the breadth of the Oxus; it is 100 m. deep, runs at 8–10 km a hour; the region lacks timber, and Al. crossed it by a local method known to von Schwarz. Bessus fled to Nautaca, conjecturally Shahr-i-Sabz, and then probably towards Maracanda (Samarkand); the place where he was

captured cannot be identified. Al. must have replaced his horses at Karshi (iii 30, 6), still the great centre for horse-trading c. 1900, and the fort where he was wounded (30, 10) will be Kungur-tau nearby. Karshi is 142 km from Samarkand, which Al. reached on the 4th day (QC. 6, 10), i.e. at about 35 km a day. Thence he must have marched along the foot of the Alai range to the Syr-Darya at a point von Schwarz decisively identified with Khodjend near Leninabad. His new city here, Alexandria Eschate, was built in 20 days (A. iv 4, 1) or 17 (QC. 6, 26 f.); in von Schwarz’ day all buildings in this region were still of mud. Of the rebel cities in iv 3 von Schwarz conclusively identified Cyropolis with Ura-Tyube from A’s description, and on the ground that town sites here are unalterably fixed by geographical factors gave more conjectural identities to the others. In iv 5, 3 we read that on Pharnuches’ approach Spitamenes withdrew from the siege of Samarkand to the ‘royal residence (βαςίλεια)’ of Sogdiana. Since Samarkand itself was the capital of Sogdiana, editors have emended, with little palaeographical plausibility, to ‘the north (βόρεια)’ of Sogdiana. The emendation should be rejected: von Schwarz observed that the emirs, and presumably the satraps, needed both winter and summer capitals, Bukhara and Samarkand; here the former is meant. Pharnuches’ force was destroyed by the river Zeravshan on the road to Bukhara. According to iv 6, 3 Al. covered 1,500 stades or 278 km in his march to relieve Samarkand; by the modern road the distance is 290. But A. makes him cover this mileage in 3 days; this is surely incredible (with infantry). QC. vii 9, 21 reports that he reached the scene of Pharnuches’ defeat on the 4th day out of
