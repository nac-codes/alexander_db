Samarkand, and I suspect that A. has confused the two marches.
17. After extensive devastations Al. withdrew to Bactra for the winter 329/8 (iv 7, 1), returning in spring (15, 7) for systematic pacification with five separate forces (16, 2), whose movements cannot be traced. QC. vii 10, 14 ff. takes him on a waterless march of 330 km from the Oxus to Merv, which A. ignores and of which QC. gives no details, though the hardships would have been appalling. Von Schwarz rightly rejects it (like most historians), but makes Al. visit Merv in 330, which is also impossible; he never went there (§11). Spitamenes attacked Bactra while A. was in Sogdiana (16, 4 ff.); the desert of
17, 1 (contra von Schwarz) must be that between Balkh and the Oxus. After his attack failed, Spitamenes must have withdrawn to the Turkestan steppes west of the Oxus, where the Massagetae may be located, though Gabae cannot be identified (17, 4).
18. In 328/327 Al. wintered in Sogdiana, himself at Nautaca (17, 3; 18, 2), but started operations very early in spring 327 (18, 4), with deep snow still on the mountains (18, 5; 21, 10). He must have taken the road leading towards Termez from Shahr-i-Sabz, for von Schwarz locates the Rock of Sogdiana at Baisun-tau, some 20 km east of Derbend, more on the basis of QC’s than of A’s description. Thence he moved further east, for A’s Rock of Chorienes (QC’s Rock of Sisimithres) can be certainly identified with Koh-i-Nor at a point where the road from Dushambe (Stalinabad) to Boldzhuan crosses the river Vachsh about 80 km SE of Stalinabad; von

Schwarz shows that it was in fact impregnable. Once again QC. has an excellent description; the emendation in viii 2, 19 of an unknown place-name to Nautaca is the product of editorial ignorance. From this rock Al. must have returned to the Oxus at Termez via Stalinabad and roughly the modern railway route down the Surkhan valley; thence to Balkh.
19. It was late spring 327 when he recrossed the Hindu-Kush in 10 days by a different pass to his city under the ‘Caucasus’ (iv 22, 4 n.). Thence he will have descended to Jellalabad in the Kabul valley (22, 6) via the Laghman route (Foucher). Here he divided his forces. Hephaestion and Perdiccas were sent direct to Peucelaotis, i.e. Charsadda (Wheeler) and the Indus (22, 7), not by the Khyber pass which leads to Peshawar but by the Michni pass further north (Foucher I 36 ff.). He himself proceeded to pacify the peoples in the hills and valleys north of the Kabul river. Strabo xv 1, 17, summarizing Ar’s account of the climate in N.W. India, which A. omits, says on his authority that the march from Alexandria began only after the setting of the Pleiads, i.e. in November. Here again we have a long pause in Al’s operations which A. does not mention, still less explain. Perhaps he had sent envoys to Taxilas and other Indian princes and was awaiting news of their attitudes. Taxilas in fact came to offer him allegiance, presumably at Jellalabad (22, 6 n.). The delay meant that the operations recounted by A. iv 23 ff. took place in winter and early spring 327/326. Stein thinks Aornos may have fallen in April (iv 29, 1 n.). Al. reached Taxila in spring 326 (Ar. ap. Strabo l.c.). This made it impossible for
