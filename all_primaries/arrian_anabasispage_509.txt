the hostile tribes to take refuge in snow-clad mountains; Aornos, with a large, flat and cultivated surface on the summit, was an exceptional stronghold. A. ignores these conditions, though they were described by Ar.
20. Al’s own route cannot be followed in any detail until his arrival in Swat. The river Choes (23, 2) must be the Kūnar; after marching up this valley, he crossed the mountains into Bajaur (24, 6); the passage of the Guraios (Sanskrit, Gaurï) or Panjkora (25, 7) brought him into the land of the Assaceni, which must be Swat and Bunēr. Sir Aurel Stein held on good grounds that Bazira (27, 5, etc.) or Beira (QC. viii 10, 22) is Bir-Kot in Upper Swat and Ora, evidently higher up the Swat valley, probably Ude-Gram; the capital of the Assaceni, Massaga (26, 1, cf. Strabo xv 1, 27), must be in Lower Swat, where there is more rich land; moreover, Al. reached it first, moving up the valley. All this fits the fact that at Ora there was hope of aid from Abisares (27, 7), ruling in Hazara (round Abbottabad) across the Indus; moreover the people in these parts took refuge at Aornos, which Stein proved was Pir-Sar, overlooking the Indus (this detail in QC. viii 11, 7 was vital for Stein’s discovery, though in general A’s description is better); easy passes lead from Upper Swat to the right bank of the Indus. Before assailing Aornos, Al. had thus to descend to the Indus via Charsadda (28, 6). Embolima (28, 7) or Ecbolima (QC.) cannot be identified. The final operations against the Assaceni are thought to have been in Bunēr (30, 5 f.; the site of Dyrta is not known). Fuller’s account (245 ff.) makes Stein’s discoveries more accessible, see also map, p. 125.

21. We hear of catapults in use in Sogdiana (iv 2, 3; 4, 4) and of perhaps other siege-engines there (3, 1) and at Massaga (26, 5) and Aornos (30, 1). In India sailors from the Mediterranean were available to man Al’s river-flotilla (vi 1, 6; Ind. 18, 1). These allusions suggest that Al. had with him on his marches considerable impedimenta and many camp-followers, adding to the number of his men, as estimated in Appendix XIII (cf. 7 above), and making it harder to see how he could have kept up the rate of advance in 330 which the evidence seems to require. On certain occasions we are told that the baggage was despatched by easier and presumably longer routes than those he took himself (iii 18, 1; 23, 2). I would suppose that this was usual, and that in the long march from Hyrcania to Parapamisus the baggage train must have followed in the rear. The whole army need not have reached Ghazni in Nov. 330, nor have crossed the Hindu-Kush in early spring 329; note the long wait at Bactra before the march to the Syr-Darya, where we first hear again of engines.

1. The diversity of modern accounts (e.g. Tarn ii 182 ff., G. T. Griffith, JHS 1947, 77 ff., A. R. Burn, ib. 1952, 84 f., N. G. L. Hammond, Hist, of Greece, 615 ff., Fuller, 163 ff. and E. W. Marsden, Campaign of Gaugamela) shows that agreement among scholars on
