the problems has not been attained and suggests that it is unattainable.
2. Not even the site has been securely identified, but this hardly matters, since it is clear that the battle was fought in a wide plain, advantageous to Darius’ numerical superiority. That superiority is proved by Al’s dispositions of his forces with a reserve phalanx which could face about, if the Persian got to his rear, and with mixed forces of cavalry and infantry (see Marsden 50, citing Xenophon, Hipparchicus
5, 13) set at an angle to his right and left flanks, to impede envelopment. This arrangement cannot be questioned, since D. 57 and QC. iv 13, 26 ff., drawing on a common source which is not A’s, from which each gives incomplete extracts, broadly agree with A’s account, and while the actual confusion in the fighting may help to explain the confusion in all descriptions of it, there was no like reason why historians should have been unable to ascertain the prior dispositions of the commanders. Unfortunately ‘at an angle’ can be interpreted in various ways (see the works and plans of the scholars cited above), between which I cannot decide.
3. All the sources also give the Persian infantry, ill-armed
and ill-trained, no important part in the battle. Hence, their numbers do not matter; the figures given (1,000,000 with some reserve by A’s sources, 800,000 by D. 53, 3, 400,000 by J. xi 12, 5 and 200,000 by QC. iv 12, 13, though inconsistently in 9, 3 he makes Darius’ army half as large again as in 333, for which see iii 2, 2), like those for the cavalry, were of course intended to show Al. as a David destroying a Goliath, whereas in fact he had a decisive superiority in quality. As to the cavalry,

we can disregard D’s 200,000 and J’s 100,000, but A’s 40,000 and QC’s 45,000 are more reasonable; perhaps the document used by Ar. gave their number (in which case QC’s figure must be invention). Marsden estimates their strength at 34,000, on the assumptions that the lines of the two armies were approximately equal and that the length of the Macedonian line can be calculated; of these the first seems to be false (cf. para. 2), and the second far too optimistic. We do not know if A’s figure for Al’s numbers (40,000 foot and 7,000 horse) is accurate (App. XIII 1), and indeed Marsden himself reaches a new estimate, not much different, on the basis of the original size of Al’s army in 334 (forgetting the forces he took over in Asia), plus attested reinforcements (not all of which may be recorded) and less garrisons and casualties, which he minimizes. He also assumes that the phalanx was drawn up 16 deep, and not 8 deep, as at Issus (App, III 3), though at Gaugamela Al. had every reason to extend rather than deepen his line. For other objections see Hammond’s review in JHS 1966, 252 f. All that we can safely say is that the Macedonian cavalry were substantially outnumbered.
4. Of the actual battle A’s account is not wholly clear (as shown especially by Griffith) and has too little about fighting under Parmenio on the left, not perhaps because Ptolemy, fighting on the right, knew little of it (he could surely have found out), but because all historians wished to attribute the glory to Al., if not to depreciate Parmenio. Nor does A. harmonize with D. 57–61, still less with the muddled story (evidently from D’s source) in QC., who can even confuse left and right wings. Neither does
