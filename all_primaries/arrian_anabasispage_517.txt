no. 137) F. 11 (Athenaeus xiii 576 DE), Al. acted after a drunken party at the instigation of the courtesan, Thais (D., QC. and ‘some accounts’ in P.). If this was true, Pt. had a special reason (apart from his partiality to Al.) to conceal it; Thais was his mistress by whom he had three children, one of whom, Lagus, was old enough to win a chariot race in 308/7 (Athenaeus l.c., cf. Dittenberger, Sylloge Inscriptionum Graecarum3 314). QC 7, 10 f. says that the official version was invented to cover up the truth.
2. However this may be, it must be admitted that in this instance A’s sources did justice to the good sense of Parmenio. The reference to his disagreement with Al., like all others, may go back to Callisthenes, who probably traduced him (App. VI 6). Callisthenes could well have fully approved of retribution on the Persians, and he wrote before Al. himself had repented; his design would not have been to set Parmenio in a favourable light. There is some reason to think that his history went down to 329 (Jacoby on F. 38); the argument that he cannot have recorded Al’s Seythian campaign (iv 1 if.), because he did not mention or deny Al’s meeting with the queen of the Amazons (iv 15, 4 n.), is absurd; he would not have recorded what did not happen, and he had no occasion to refute a fiction that had not yet been invented. If he did tell of Parmenio’s advice here, it was hard for later writers to expunge it from the record.
3. A’s account in iii 18 has various omissions. Nothing of the appointment of a Macedonian general alongside the Persian satrap, which we should expect, cf. QC. v 6, 11 (Nicarchides with 3,000 men). Nothing of Tiridates (§ 1), and no details of the Persian treasure. Here our sources are discordant

and untrustworthy. Cf. for treasure seized at Arbela, A. iii 15, 5 (no figure); D. 64, 3 (3,000 Talents of silver); QC. v 1, 10 (4,000); at Babylon, A. iii 16, 3; QC. v 1, 23 (no figures); at Susa, A. iii 16, 7 (c. 50,000, cf. QC. 2, 11); D. 66, 1 (40,000 plus 9,000 of gold, i.e. perhaps gold bullion worth 9,000 T.); P. 36, 1 (40,000 in coin); Strabo xv 3, 9 (50,000 or 40,000); at Persepolis, A. iii 18, 10 (no figure); D. 71, 1 (gold bullion worth 120,000, cf. QC. 6, 9 adding 6,000 at Pasargadae); P. 37, 2 (as much in coins as at Susa, i.e. 40,000). Strabo l.c. says that all were brought together at Ecbatana (A. iii 20, 7) and amounted to 180,000, perhaps implying 10,000–20,000
at Babylon, but much more if P. 37, 2 is right. Darius left Ecbatana with 7,000 T. (A. 19, 5) or 8,000 (Strabo), all taken by his murderers (Strabo), but D. makes Al. receive 8,000 from the royal treasurers after his death (74, 4) and QC. vi 2, 10 26,000 from recent booty.
Appendix XI
The deaths of philotas and parmenio
1. A. cites Ar. as well as Pt. at iii 26, 1, but thereafter for reasons unknown relies solely on Pt’s account of the trial of Philotas and murder of Parmenio. At 27, 1 he then proceeds: ‘they say that Amyntas too . . .’; the ‘they’ are certainly Pt. and Ar. once more. QC. (vi 7–vii 2) has rhetorically embellished the story, especially with fictitious speeches, but no one thinks that the ‘vulgate’ can here be totally neglected, cf. also D. 79 f.; P. 48 f.; J. xii 5.
