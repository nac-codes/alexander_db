Caspian, caucasus, tanais
1. In both Al’s day and A’s it was believed that the known landmass of Europe, Asia and Africa was encircled by the Ocean or ‘great sea’ to which A. often refers. Before Al. little was known in Greece of Iran and India. Much was discovered on the expedition; however, Al. and those who recorded his journeys were dependent on mere reports of country they did not see for themselves, which they could easily misinterpret; moreover, Strabo, following Eratosthenes (cf. A. v 3), castigates their contradictions and geographical falsifications, designed in his view to magnify Al’s exploits (ii 1, 9; xi 5, 5; 6, 4; 7, 4; xv 1 passim, especially § 2, 9 and 28; xvi 1, 3); in reality some at least of the errors were due to genuine misunderstandings. Much more became known of Iran and India under Al’s successors, but even this increase of knowledge did not save Eratosthenes (c. 275–194) and later geographers from serious mistakes.
2. Thus before Al. it had been disputed whether the Caspian sea (vii 16, 3), sometimes called the Hyrcanian
sea (A. iii 29, 2; v 5, 4 and 26,1) or ‘the Caspian and Hycanian sea’ (vii 16, 2), was a gulf of the Ocean or, as Herodotus held (i 202 f.), a lake (cf. P. 44, 1 f.); on the latter view, Al. thought that it might be connected with the Black Sea, or more precisely with the Sea of Azov (the Maeotic lake), whose size Herodotus grossly exaggerated (iv 86), and at the end of his life he was preparing an exploratory expedition

to ascertain the truth (A. vii 16). Thus he was not as certain of this hypothesis as, according to Strabo xi 7, 4, his historians were. Polyclitus (who, to judge from this last text, accompanied Al.) took the Caspian to be a lake, as it had sea-serpents (unconfirmed) and as the water was sweetish (in fact salinity is low, especially by river mouths); he held it was connected by an underground passage with the Sea of Azov. This may be reconcileable with Ar’s account (Strabo v 26, 1) of a trade route from Oxus to Caspian and then overland to the Black Sea (on which see Pearson 163), but a ‘speech of Al.’ (written up by A.) treats the Caspian as a gulf of Ocean (v 26, 1). Patrocles’ explorations, c. 284/283, were to convince Eratosthenes and Strabo (ii, 5, 18, cf. A. v 3, 4) that this was true, and A. iii 29 follows suit by making the Oxus flow into the 1 great sea in its Hyrcanian part’. Here, in giving the Oxus (Amu Darya) an outlet into the Caspian, he agrees with Ar. (Strabo xi 7, 3), nor did he doubt (vii, 16, 3) that Ar. (iii 30, 7) was right in making the Jaxartes (Syr Darya) have the same outlet. Today both rivers flow into the Aral Sea, and the Syr Darya has always done so, though there is some evidence that the Oxus did once flow into the Caspian; the Aral, however, was apparently not known in antiquity (J. O. Thomson, Hist, of Anc. Geography 128; contra but unconvincingly,
J. R. Hamilton, CQ 1971, 110 ff.). Ar. was also wrong in making the Jaxartes rise in the Hindu-Kush,
and not 700 miles north-west in the modern Kirgiz.
3. A. iii 28, 4 f. and 30, 7 show that Caucasus was Ar’s name for the Hindu-Kush. The followers of Alexander thus identified the true (‘Scythian’)
