Appendix XIII
Alexander’s army 331–326
1. At Gaugamela the Grand Army consisted of (at most) about 40,000 foot and 7,000 horse, cf. Introd. 56 f. The Macedonians included in these totals were the survivors of 15,000 foot (archers excluded) and 2,100 Companions and perhaps 800 prodromoi, who had been with Alexander since 334 or joined him in 333.
2. Both before and after Gaugamela the numbers of reinforcements and garrisons are more often reported by QC., or even D., than by A. There is no reason in principle to distrust their data, since they seem to preserve ‘documentary’ material of other kinds (appointments and marches), though in detail they may be in error, and they too are not necessarily more complete in this kind of documentation than in any other. The size of the garrison A. records in Bactria (iv 22, 3) in itself shows that Al. must have received considerable reinforcements between 331 and 327, especially as he must also have left troops behind in other parts of Iran (§ 3); so much is implied by A. himself, when he names provincial generals or commandants of citadels, and is stated in iii 19, 7 (Media). Al’s foundations of cities in Iran are also relevant; for the best collection of evidence cf. Droysen (App. VIII 12). A. mentions only the Alexandrias in Parapamisus and on the Jaxartes (iii 28, 4; iv 1, 3; 4, 1; 22, 5), perhaps because they alone were founded under Al’s personal superintendence, but other such cities in Areia, Drangiane, Arachosia and

Bactria were evidently founded on his orders, and (it is natural to suppose) in 330–327, since he was never in these parts again; presumably all had a nucleus of soldiers drawn from the local garrisons, including Macedonians unfit for further campaigns, but predominantly mercenaries.
3. The following garrisons and detachments are actually attested outside Media (for which see § 5 below):

Babylon1,000 (including 700 Macedonians, QC. v 1, 43; D. 64, 5)
Syria and Babylonia2,000 (QC. 1.c.)
Persepolis3,000 (Macedonians, QC. v 6,
11)
Arachosia4,600 (QC. vii 3, 5)
Bactria13,500 (A. iv 22, 3)
Total24,100

The force in Bactria was no doubt intended to hold down Sogdiane and perhaps Parapamisus too; it would be unwise to assume that Media, Hyrcania, Areia and Drangiane did not also require substantial forces, who were probably found from the troops Al. left in Media in June 330.
4. In the same period reinforcements are attested, amounting to 45,500 foot and perhaps over 6,000 horse.
331–330 (up to Alexander’s arrival at Ecbatana); see A. iii 16, 10; D. 65, 1; QC. v 1, 40 f.; 7,12.
