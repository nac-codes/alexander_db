5. A. iii 19, 5 ff. says that at Ecbatana Al. (a) dismissed all the Greek allies, except those who would take service as mercenaries, i.e. the survivors of 7,000 foot and 2,750 horse, mainly Thessalian (Introd. 56 f.); (b) detached up to 6,000 Macedonians, apparently foot (Introd. 61), with a few horse and light troops under Harpalus to guard the treasures; the 6,000 seem to have rejoined him later; (c) left Parmenio in command of the mercenaries, Thracians and all cavalry except the Companions. This last statement is not correct, since Al. still had the prodromoi with him in his pursuit of Darius (cf. also iv 4, 6), as well as Erigyius’ mercenary horse (iii 20, 1; 23, 2), and he could give Erigyius and others 6,000 Greek foot and 600 horse against Satibarzanes (QC. vii 3, 2, cf. A. iii 28, 2), at a time when Greek reinforcements received earlier in the summer numbered only 2,000 foot and 130 horse, and before any troops left with Parmenio had yet rejoined him (infra). However, we should probably assume that Parmenio had command of most of the forces A. names, while Al. had all the Macedonians except those detached with Harpalus (supra) together with the Balkan contingents (e.g. the Agrianians, iii 20, 1) other than the Thracians. With no allowance for losses, the Macedonians numbered 17,900 (§ 1)–3,700 (§ 3) + 6,500 (§ 4)–6,000 (§ 5) = 14,700; the Balkan troops can

never have exceeded c. 4,000; and though the strength of the other units with Al. cannot be determined, it is clear that with losses taken into account, his army is unlikely to have numbered 25,000 men. The larger part of his forces, c. 47,000 less losses at Gaugamela, detachments of 6,000 (§ 3) and Greek allies sent home but plus reinforcements of up to 21,600 (§ 4), must have been left with Parmenio and Harpalus. Parmenio was intended to invade Hyrcania
from the west (iii 19, 7), a task he never performed, we do not know why. As for Harpalus’ 6,000 Macedonians, Black Clitus had instructions to bring them on to Parthyaea after the treasure had been deposited at Ecbatana (iii 19, 8), and they were evidently the 6,000 who joined Al. on the road to Arachosia along with 200 ‘nobiles’ (probably Companion cavalry also left behind) and 5,000 Greek foot and 500 horse (QC. vii 3, 4); these men had apparently been sent forward by Parmenio and are not included in my figures for reinforcements.
6. Media lay on the most direct route to the Mediterranean, via Babylon but by-passing Susa and Persepolis,
and it would not be surprising if an exceptionally large garrison remained there, perhaps larger than the 5,000 foot and 1,000 horse with which its generals rejoined Al. in Carmania later in 325 (QC. x 1, 2, cf. A. vi 27, 3). But probably some of Parmenio’s
men were moved forward into Hyrcania (where Thracians were serving in 327/326, cf. A. iv 18, 2; v 20, 7) and Parthyaea. It would be consistent with the known data if the total of troops left in these regions were about 12,000, and that figure would also correspond to the garrisons in Areia-Arachosia and Bactria.
