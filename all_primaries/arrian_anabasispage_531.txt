7. By autumn 330 Al’s field army had been increased by over 8,000 new mercenaries (§ 4) and by nearly 12,000 men sent on from Ecbatana (§ 5). This would have brought up its strength to perhaps over 40,000. However, it was immediately reduced by 11,200. First, Al. detached 6,600 men to repress Satibarzanes (§ 5); Erigyius, the commander, rejoined him at Bactra in summer 329 (QC. vii 4, 40, cf. A. iii 28, 2), but surely without his whole army, since shortly afterwards Stasanor was despatched to deal with new trouble in Areia (iii 29, 5), with no mention of troops, and Al. would hardly have left Areia and Drangiane ungarrisoned. Secondly, he left 4,600 men in Arachosia (§ 3) and surely some troops in Parapamisus, the jumping off ground for the Indian campaign he meditated in 328 (iv 15) and probably earlier; perhaps it is enough to point to the Alexandria founded there. A fair balance between casualties and detachments on the one side, and reinforcements on the other, might suggest that he invaded Bactria in spring 329 with some 25,000 European troops. Erigyius doubtless brought up part of his army, and in 329/328 he received 22,000 more men from Europe (§ 4). But casualties from hardships in the fighting of 329–327 cannot have been light; 2,000 men were lost in his one disaster here (iv 6, 2 cf. 3, 7), and he left 13,500 men at Bactra (iv 22, 3). He must have had no more than 35,000 European troops with him at the outset of the Indian campaign.
8. Curtius, however, alleges that he had 120,000 men for this expedition (viii 5, 4). If this were the truth, we should have to suppose that two thirds of his army consisted of Orientals. Some were undoubtedly now in his army (Introd. 59), but the proportion must be

vastly too high. Now Nearchus estimated that he had 120,000 ‘fighting men’ with him on the Hydaspes in 326 (Ind. 19, 5), explicitly including Orientals, and Plutarch (66, 2) makes this the maximum of his foot in the Indian campaigns, adding 15,000 horse. But by 326 he had received further reinforcements from the west, over 30,000 foot and nearly 6,000 horse according to D. 95, 4, though only 7,000 foot and 5,000 horse according to QC. ix 3, 21. Moreover Taxilas, Porus and other Indian princes had provided over 10,000 men (v 8, 5; 24, 4). These figures alone show that Curtius is wrong; perhaps he has retrojected
to the outset of the expedition the total given in his source for the largest army Al. commanded in India. But that total, despite the authority of Nearchus, is surely too high. For his operations in India, especially after Porus’ defeat, Al. did not need forces so much greater than those with which he had conquered the Persian empire, and how could he have supplied them? One may suspect that as in the past his historians inflated Persian numbers to make his victories appear more astounding, so they now inflated the size of his own army, to impress readers with the magnitude of his power. In any event his real strength still lay in his European and especially in his Macedonian troops.
9. The relatively small size of Al.’s army after Ecbatana helps to explain the increased rapidity of his movements (cf. App. VIII 7); a still smaller force, like the 11,000 men who caught him up in Arachosia, could make still greater speed. (It might seem from iii 19, 7 that the 6,000 Macedonians among them had had to march from Ecbatana to Persepolis and back before coming on to Al., of course without any
