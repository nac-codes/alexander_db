Plutarch’s Lives

ἀφελόμενος τὸν αὑτοῦ προσέθηκε τῷ ἐκείνου
6στόματι τὴν σφραγῖδα. Μαζαίου δὲ τοῦ
μεγίστου παρὰ Δαρείῳ γενομένου παιδὶ σατραπείαν
ἔχοντι δευτέραν προσετίθει μείζονα. παραιτούμενος
δὲ ἐκεῖνος εἶπεν· “Ὦ βασιλεῦ, τότε
μὲν ἦν εἷς Δαρεῖος, νῦν δὲ σὺ πολλοὺς πεποίηκας
Ἀλεξάνδρους.” Παρμενίωνι μὲν οὖν τὸν Βαγώου
ἔδωκεν οἶκον τὸν περὶ Σοῦσα,1 ἐν ᾧ λέγεται χιλίων
ταλάντων εὑρεθῆναι ἱματισμόν. πρὸς δ᾿ Ἀντίπατρον
ἔγραψε κελεύων ἔχειν φύλακας τοῦ σώματος
7ὡς ἐπιβουλευόμενον. τῇ δὲ μητρὶ πολλὰ
μὲν ἐδωρεῖτο καὶ κατέπεμπεν, οὐκ εἴα δὲ πολυπραγμονεῖν
οὐδὲ παραστρατηγεῖν· ἐγκαλούσης δὲ
πρᾴως ἔφερε τὴν χαλεπότητα. πλὴν ἅπαξ ποτὲ
Ἀντιπάτρου μακρὰν κατ᾿ αὐτῆς γράψαντος ἐπιστολὴν
ἀναγνοὺς ἀγνοεῖν εἶπεν Ἀντίπατρον ὅτι
μυρίας ἐπιστολὰς ἓν δάκρυον ἀπαλείφει μητρός.


XL. Ἐπεὶ δὲ τοὺς περὶ αὑτὸν ἑώρα παντάπασιν
ἐκτετρυφηκότας καὶ φορτικοὺς ταῖς διαίταις
καὶ πολυτελείαις ὄντας, ὥστε Ἅγνωνα μὲν
τὸν Τήϊον ἀργυροῦς ἐν ταῖς κρηπῖσιν ἥλους
φορεῖν, Λεοννάτῳ δὲ πολλαῖς καμήλοις ἀπ᾿ Αἰγύπτου
κόνιν εἰς τὰ γυμνάσια παρακομίζεσθαι,
Φιλώτᾳ δὲ πρὸς θήρας σταδίων ἑκατὸν αὐλαίας
γεγονέναι, μύρῳ δὲ χρωμένους ἰέναι πρὸς ἄλειμμα
καὶ λουτρὸν ὅσους οὐδὲ ἐλαίῳ, τρίπτας δὲ καὶ
κατευναστὰς περιαγομένους, ἐπετίμησε πρᾴως
2καὶ φιλοσόφως, θαυμάζειν φάμενος εἰ τοσούτους
ἠγωνισμένοι καὶ τηλικούτους ἀγῶνας οὐ μνημονεύουσιν
ὅτι τῶν καταπονηθέντων οἱ καταπονήσαντες

from his own finger and applied its seal to the lips of Hephaestion. Again, though the son of Mazaeus, the most influential man at the court of Dareius, already had a province, Alexander gave him a second and a larger one. He, however, declined it, saying: “O King, formerly there was one Dareius, but now thou hast made many Alexanders.” To Parmenio, moreover, Alexander gave the house of Bagoas at Susa, in which it is said there was found apparel worth a thousand talents. Again, he wrote to Antipater bidding him keep guards about his person, since plots were being laid against him. To his mother, also, he sent many presents, but would not suffer her to meddle in affairs nor interfere in his campaigns; and when she chided him for this, he bore her harshness patiently. Once, however, after reading a long letter which Antipater had written in denunciation of her, he said Antipater knew not that one tear of a mother effaced ten thousand letters.


XL. He saw that his favourites had grown altogether luxurious, and were vulgar in the extravagance of their ways of living. For instance, Hagnon the Teian used to wear silver nails in his boots; Leonnatus
had dust for his gymnastic exercises brought to him on many camels from Egypt; Philotas had hunting-nets a hundred furlongs long; when they took their exercise and their baths, more of them actually used myrrh than olive oil, and they had in their train rubbers and chamberlains. Alexander therefore chided them in gentle and reasonable fashion. He was amazed, he said, that after they had undergone so many and so great contests they did not remember that those who conquer by toil sleep more sweetly than those who are conquered
